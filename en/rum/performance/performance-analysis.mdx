The performance data analysis page helps identify the root causes of browser performance issues by analyzing real user traffic data. Use browser metrics such as Core Web Vitals and custom loading time metrics to troubleshoot slow page loading. These metrics evaluate complete page load time from the user's perspective.

## Accessing Performance Analysis

Navigate to the Performance Monitoring menu, where you can analyze performance experience from different perspectives through list or tree views.
