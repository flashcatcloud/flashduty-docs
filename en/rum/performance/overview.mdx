## Performance Monitoring Workflow

Flashduty RUM performance optimization consists of three key phases:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Problem Identification">
    Quickly discovering performance problem trigger points is the first step in diagnosis. Flashduty RUM provides the following ways to help you identify problems:

    - **Data Analysis**: View data trends of core performance metrics through the "Application Management - Data Analysis" module
    - **User Feedback**: Discover potential problems through user reports (such as slow page loading or interaction lag)
    - **Anomaly Detection**: Observe anomaly trends, such as increased resource loading failure rates or extended API response times

    </Frame>

    **Initial Assessment:**
    - **Impact Scope**: Determine the user groups affected by the problem (e.g., specific regions, devices, or browsers)
    - **Severity**: Assess the direct impact of the problem on user experience
    - **Business Impact**: Analyze the impact of the problem on key business metrics (such as conversion rate or user retention)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Collection">
    Flashduty RUM provides rich performance data and contextual information:

    **Core Performance Data:**
    - **Page Loading Metrics**: Including LCP, FCP, TTI
    - **Resource Loading Time**: Analyze loading time of images, scripts, CSS, and other resources
    - **JavaScript Performance**: Monitor script execution time and render-blocking scripts
    - **Network Requests**: Record API request latency, success rate, and error rate

    **Contextual Information:**
    - **User Environment**: Browser type, device model, operating system, and network conditions
    - **Error Logs**: Capture detailed information about JavaScript errors, network errors, and resource loading failures
    - **System Resources**: Analyze CPU usage, memory consumption, and DOM operation frequency
  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Localization and Classification">
    Through visualization tools and analysis features, classify performance problems and precisely locate root causes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common Problem Classification

| Problem Type | Typical Symptoms | Possible Causes | Key Metrics |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Slow Page Loading** | Long white screen time, slow first screen rendering | Large resource size, render-blocking scripts or CSS, slow server response | LCP, FCP, TTI |
| **Interaction Response Delay** | No response to clicks, laggy operations | Long JavaScript execution time, too many event listeners, frequent DOM operations | FID, INP, TBT |
| **Resource Loading Errors** | Image/script loading failure, timeout | CDN configuration errors, unstable network, incorrect resource paths | Resource loading time, failure rate |
| **JavaScript Errors** | Feature failure, console errors | Code logic errors, browser compatibility issues, memory leaks | Error rate, memory usage |
| **Network Connection Issues** | Request timeout, connection interruption | Slow API response, poor network quality, cross-origin configuration errors | Request latency, connection success rate |

    **Key Time Points:**
    - **Navigation Start**: Time when user initiates page request
    - **DNS Lookup**: Domain name resolution time
    - **TCP Connection**: Time to establish server connection
    - **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: Time to receive the first byte of server response
    - **DOM Complete**: Time when page DOM structure is fully loaded

    **Resource Loading Analysis:**
    - **Critical Path**: Identify critical resources affecting page rendering
    - **Blocking Resources**: Discover scripts or stylesheets blocking rendering
    - **Loading Order**: Optimize resource loading priority
    - **Resource Size**: Check for oversized resources
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Error Analysis">
    Flashduty RUM captures and categorizes frontend errors, providing detailed contextual information.

    **Error Types:**
    - JavaScript runtime errors (such as uncaught exceptions or syntax errors)
    - Network request errors (such as API timeouts or 4xx/5xx errors)
    - Resource loading errors (such as image or script loading failures)
    - Framework-related errors (such as React or Vue component rendering errors)

    **Error Context:**
    - **Error Stack**: Provides detailed call stack information
    - **User Action Sequence**: Reproduce the operation path that triggered the error
    - **Environment Information**: Includes browser, device, and network status
    - **Related Performance Data**: Correlate errors with performance metric changes
