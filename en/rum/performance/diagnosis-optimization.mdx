The optimization page helps identify the root causes of browser performance issues based on real user traffic data. Use browser metrics (such as Core Web Vitals and Flashduty custom loading time metrics) to troubleshoot slow page loading. These metrics can evaluate complete page load time from the user's perspective.

For deeper analysis, the optimization page provides detailed breakdowns of Core Web Vitals by user demographics (such as browser, region, and app version). You can use this information to track performance trends, understand the most affected user groups, and optimize precisely.

## Diagnosis and Optimization Workflow

You can navigate to the optimization page, located under the Performance Monitoring menu, and select the metric you want to analyze. You can also jump to this feature by viewing corresponding performance data in the analytics dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Metric Selection">
    After selecting a page and metric, you can start performance data analysis:

    1. Click on a metric card to select the metric to analyze (currently supports LCP, FCP, INP)
    2. Select a group in "Show Filter Breakdown"
    3. Evaluate metrics at different percentiles (e.g., p75 represents the 75th percentile value)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Data Viewing">
    You can view the data performance of the metric under different conditions by adjusting the data aggregation method or modifying filter conditions, thereby advancing diagnosis and optimization work.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Diagnosis">
    In the problem diagnosis section, you can see resources and errors that users encountered on the page that may affect metric performance.

    <Tip>
    For example, for Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), you can view resources loaded before LCP was triggered. Since LCP is a metric for the time it takes for the largest element to load on the page, you can diagnose problems from both resource loading and error resolution perspectives.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Event Samples">
    If you cannot locate key information more accurately during the resource analysis phase, you can select appropriate event samples in the event samples section for more detailed contextual analysis.

## Optimization Directions

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Optimize Resource Loading">
    - View the loading status of resources under this view, focusing on resources with longer loading times for optimization
    - View which resources cause rendering issues in the "Blocking Resources" panel
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Resolve Errors">
    - Focus on recurring errors that may cause problems, as these anomalies also affect page performance
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Waterfall Chart Analysis">
    - The waterfall chart shows the timeline of events when the metric was captured
    - Scroll down to view context for the rest of the page activity
    - Use the dropdown in the upper left corner to select another sample event
    - Click to expand any event in the waterfall to view the side panel
    - Select appropriate event sets for problem analysis by filtering event types and various filter options
  </Tab>
