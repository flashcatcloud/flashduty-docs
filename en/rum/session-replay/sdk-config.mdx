Flashduty RUM's session replay feature is integrated into the RUM SDK. By simply configuring the sampling rate and privacy rules, you can quickly enable the replay feature.

## Enable Collection

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automatic Collection">
    The replay SDK is integrated into the RUM SDK. Configure the sampling rate to enable the replay feature:

    ```javascript
    window.FC_RUM.init({
      applicationId: "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
      clientToken: "YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN",
      // ...
      sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Default session replay sampling rate 10%
      // ...
    });
    ```

    <Note>
    **Sampling Method**: When the client SDK initializes a session, it generates a random number between 0-1 and compares it with `rate/100`. If it falls within the range, the session becomes a collection sample, and replay data will be collected and reported during the session lifecycle.

    Based on the session being sampled, the session replay sampling rate (sessionReplaySampleRate) will be calculated and sampled a second time.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Manual Collection">
    After configuring the sampling rate by default, automatic collection starts after `RUM.init()` executes. If you want to manually control the collection timing (such as collecting data only after user login), you can enable the manual collection switch and then manually call the record method:

    ```javascript
    window.FC_RUM.init({
      applicationId: "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
      clientToken: "YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN",
      // ...
      sessionReplaySampleRate: 10, // Sampling rate 10%
      startSessionReplayRecordingManually: true, // Enable manual collection switch
      // ...
    });

    if (userIsShouldRecord()) {
      // If certain conditions are met, enable replay
      window.FC_RUM.startSessionReplayRecording(); // Start data collection when called
    }
    ```

    <Tip>
    After enabling collection, you can stop collection using the `stopSessionReplayRecording()` method.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Force Enable">
    In some scenarios, even if the sampling rate doesn't hit, you may want to collect data for that session (such as monitoring newly launched features or capturing subsequent operations after an exception). In this case, you can force enable replay by calling `startSessionReplayRecording({ force: true })`.

    <Warning>
    Force enable only works when the current session is sampled but sessionReplay is not sampled. If the session itself is not sampled, force enabling replay will not work.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Disable Collection

If you need to disable the collection feature, adjust the corresponding replay sampling rate to 0 or remove the configuration item:

```javascript
window.FC_RUM.init({
  applicationId: "YOUR_APPLICATION_ID",
  clientToken: "YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN",
  // ...
  sessionReplaySampleRate: 0, // Disable replay feature
  // ...
});
```

## How It Works

The session replay SDK is based on [rrweb](https://www.rrweb.io/).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recording Phase">
    The recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors (DOM changes, mouse movements, clicks, form inputs, etc.) occur. Data is reported after serialization, compression, and removal of sensitive information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Replay Phase">
    The playback SDK reconstructs the DOM based on snapshots and converts event behaviors into DOM changes at appropriate times for display.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
- Before data reporting, the SDK compresses data in advance and executes this CPU-intensive operation in a Web Worker, without affecting main thread rendering
- SDK compatibility is consistent with RUM SDK, supporting browsers above IE11
