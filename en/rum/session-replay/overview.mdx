## Session Replay Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Behavior Recording and Replay">
    During the recording phase, the recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors (DOM changes, mouse movements, clicks, form inputs, etc.) occur. Data is reported after serialization, compression, and removal of sensitive information.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Analysis and Optimization">
    Flashduty RUM provides rich behavioral data and analysis tools to help locate problems and optimize experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Core Behavioral Data

| Data Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **User Interactions** | Timeline of clicks, scrolls, inputs, navigation, and other actions |
| **Page Performance** | Page load time, resource loading failures, API call delays, etc. |
| **Error Context** | Page state, DOM structure, and user actions when errors occur |

### Contextual Information

- **User Environment**: Browser, device, operating system, network conditions
- **Operation Path**: Complete operation sequence of user in the session
- **Page Snapshot**: Page DOM snapshot when error occurs

### Problem Types and Location

| Problem Type | Typical Symptoms | Possible Causes | Location Method |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Slow Page Loading** | White screen, loading timeout | Resource loading failure, network delay | Check for resource loading errors |
| **Feature Failure** | Button click no response | Code logic error, event binding issue | View specific behavior and errors |
| **Form Submission Failure** | Data not saved, submission failed | API response error, form validation issue | View error and exception details |

## Problem Analysis Tools

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Session Replay Panel">
    In the player, you can view all user actions including clicks, scrolls, and inputs. It supports playback controls like fast forward, replay, and seek, helping developers intuitively reproduce problem scenarios and precisely analyze user behavior.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Event and Context Correlation">
    Session replay supports correlation with various events (such as view loading, errors, user behavior), allowing you to view detailed errors and attributes (contextual information like device type, browser version, geographic location, etc.), facilitating root cause identification and in-depth analysis.
