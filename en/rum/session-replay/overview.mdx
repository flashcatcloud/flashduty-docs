## Session Replay Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Behavior Recording & Replay">
    During the recording phase, the recording SDK takes snapshots of the current DOM and CSS styles, and collects corresponding events when user behaviors occur (DOM changes, mouse movement, clicks, form input, etc.). Data is reported after serialization, compression, and sensitive information removal.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Analysis & Optimization">
    Flashduty RUM provides rich behavioral data and analysis tools to help locate problems and optimize experience.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Core Behavioral Data

| Data Type | Description |
|----------|------|
| **User Interactions** | Timeline of clicks, scrolls, inputs, navigation, and other operations |
| **Page Performance** | Page load time, resource loading failures, API call delays, etc. |
| **Exception Context** | Page state, DOM structure, and user actions when exceptions occurred |

### Contextual Information

- **User Environment**: Browser, device, operating system, network conditions
- **Operation Path**: Complete sequence of user operations in the session
- **Page Snapshot**: DOM snapshot of the page when exception occurred

### Problem Types and Location

| Problem Type | Typical Symptoms | Possible Causes | Location Method |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Slow Page Loading** | White screen, loading timeout | Resource loading failure, network latency | Check for resource loading anomalies |
| **Feature Failure** | Button click unresponsive | Code logic error, event binding issue | View specific behavior and exceptions |
| **Form Submission Failure** | Data not saved, submission failed | API response error, form validation issue | View error and exception details |

## Problem Analysis Tools

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Session Replay Panel">
    In the player, you can view all user operations including clicks, scrolls, and inputs. It supports playback controls like fast forward, replay, and seek, helping developers intuitively reproduce problem scenarios and precisely analyze user behavior.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Events & Context Correlation">
    Session replay supports correlation with various events (such as view loading, errors, user behavior), allowing you to view detailed errors and attributes (contextual information like device type, browser version, geographic location, etc.), facilitating root cause identification and in-depth analysis.
