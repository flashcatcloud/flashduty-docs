Flashduty RUM's session replay feature helps developers quickly locate problems, analyze user behavior, and optimize product experience by intuitively reproducing user operation paths. Integrated into the RUM SDK, it can be enabled with simple configuration, supporting flexible sampling strategies and privacy rule settings.

## Session List

In the "Session Replay" menu, you can view recent session records, sorted by time in descending order by default.

**Supported Features:**
- Sort by session duration, view count, action count, error count, and other fields
- Rich filtering conditions (such as time range, page, labels, etc.)

Click any record item to open the player panel:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Information Display Area** | Shows session access time, start and end pages, labels, and other contextual information |
| **Playback Area** | Reproduces operation paths from the user's perspective, clearly showing user interaction details |
| **Playback Control Area** | Provides playback control functions for easy operation |

## Player

The player supports play, pause, fast forward, rewind, replay, speed control, fullscreen, and seek functions, and supports keyboard shortcuts to improve efficiency.

During playback, user actions (Action) and errors (Error) are marked with different colored icons on the timeline, making it easy to quickly overview key events in the session.

<Tip>
By default, the player automatically skips inactive segments to improve viewing efficiency. You can also disable this feature through configuration to play completely according to actual timing.
