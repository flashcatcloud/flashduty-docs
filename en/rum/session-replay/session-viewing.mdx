Flashduty RUM's session replay feature helps developers quickly locate issues, analyze user behavior, and optimize product experience by intuitively recreating user operation paths. Integrated into the RUM SDK, it can be enabled with simple configuration, supporting flexible sampling strategies and privacy rule settings.

## Session List

In the "Session Replay" menu, you can view recent session records, sorted by time in descending order by default.

**Supported Features:**
- Sort by session duration, view count, action count, exception count, and other fields
- Rich filter conditions (such as time range, page, tags, etc.)

Click on any record to open the player panel:

| Area | Description |
|------|------|
| **Information Display Area** | Shows session visit time, start and end pages, tags, and other contextual information |
| **Playback Area** | Recreates operation path from user's perspective, clearly showing user interaction details |
| **Playback Control Area** | Provides playback control functions for easy operation |

## Player

The player supports play, pause, fast forward, rewind, replay, speed control, fullscreen, and seek functions, with keyboard shortcut support to improve efficiency.

During playback, the timeline marks user actions (Action) and exceptions (Error) with different colored icons, allowing quick overview of key events in the session.

<Tip>
By default, the player automatically skips inactive segments to improve viewing efficiency. You can also disable this feature through configuration to play completely in actual time sequence.
