## Overview

Flashduty RUM Insights dashboard provides out-of-the-box visualization dashboards that automatically collect and analyze multi-dimensional data including user sessions, performance, resources, and errors. This helps you gain comprehensive insights into your application's real-world performance, quickly identify performance bottlenecks and issues, and continuously optimize user experience.

The Insights dashboard includes four main analysis dimensions:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Overview" icon="gauge">
  Key metrics at a glance
</Card>

<Card title="Performance Analysis" icon="bolt">
  Comprehensive application experience monitoring
</Card>

<Card title="Error Analysis" icon="bug">
  Quick error identification and diagnosis
</Card>

<Card title="Resource Analysis" icon="database">
  Fine-grained resource optimization
</Card>
</CardGroup>

</Frame>

The Overview module focuses on core metrics across multiple dimensions:

| Metric Type | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Traffic Metrics** | Monitor PV (Page Views), UV (Unique Visitors), and sessions to understand overall traffic trends |
| **User Distribution** | Gain insights into user sources and active regions based on geographic location and device types |
| **Health & Performance Metrics** | Display Core Web Vitals: LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) |
| **Errors & Exceptions** | Track error rates by type to quickly identify potential risk areas |

## Performance Analysis

</Frame>

The Performance Analysis module focuses on full-chain monitoring of application loading and interaction experience:

- **Page Performance**: Monitor trends and sample distribution of core page loading metrics like FCP, LCP, and CLS
- **Long Tasks**: [Long Animation Frames](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/long-animation-frames#long-frames-api) where rendering updates are delayed beyond 50 milliseconds
- **XHR and Fetch Requests**: Analyze API loading performance to identify slow endpoints
- **Static Resources**: Analyze static resource loading times to identify performance bottlenecks during application loading

## Error Analysis

</Frame>

The Error Analysis module provides comprehensive error monitoring and diagnosis capabilities:

- **Page Error Rate**: Pages with the most errors, helping you prioritize which pages need attention
- **Top Issues**: Issues affecting the most users, see [Error Grouping](/en/rum/error-tracking/error-aggregation) for details
- **Code Errors**: Categorized display of error types, see [Error Tracking](/en/rum/error-tracking/overview) for details
- **API and Resource Errors**: Monitor which APIs and static resources generate the most errors

## Resource Analysis

</Frame>

The Resource Analysis module helps you identify resources that have the greatest impact on your application:

- **Resource Ranking**: Monitor the most frequently loaded and heaviest resources to identify optimization priorities
- **Resource Loading Timeline**: Monitor resource timing trends (DNS resolution, TCP connection, loading time, etc.)
- **XHR and Fetch Requests**: Distinguish distribution trends of different request types, methods, and error status codes
- **Third-party Resources**: Resources where the host address doesn't match the current page host are identified as third-party resources

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why is the size or timing data for some resources 0?">
This may occur due to:

1. **Connection Reuse (Keep-Alive)**: When resource requests use keep-alive to maintain connections, DNS lookups and TCP connection processes only occur on the first request, with subsequent requests reusing the same connection

2. **Cross-origin Resources**: If resources are loaded cross-origin without the appropriate headers configured, the browser cannot collect complete performance data (primary cause)

3. **Browser Compatibility**: In rare cases, some browsers may not support the Performance API
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why is resource_status 0 for some resources?">
1. **Cross-origin Resources**: If resources are loaded cross-origin without cross-origin access permissions set, the browser cannot obtain resource status information

2. **Browser Compatibility**: Some browsers may not support the Performance API (rare)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to resolve missing data for cross-origin resources?">
**1. Collect timing data for cross-origin resources**

Add the following to the HTTP response headers of cross-origin resources:

```
Timing-Allow-Origin: *
```

See MDN documentation [Resource Timing API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/Resource_timing#cross-origin_timing_information).

**2. Collect status codes for cross-origin resources**

Add the following to the HTTP response headers of cross-origin resources:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

Add `crossorigin="anonymous"` to the HTML tags that reference the resource:

```html
<img src="https://static.example.com/logo.png" crossorigin="anonymous" />
```

See MDN documentation [Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) and [crossorigin attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to collect user information?">
**Logged-in User Identification**

For applications that require user login (such as SaaS products, membership systems, e-commerce platforms, etc.), see [User Sessions](/en/rum/sdk/web/advanced-config#user-sessions).

**Device Fingerprint Identification**

For applications without login state (such as corporate websites, marketing pages, etc.), we recommend generating stable fingerprints based on multi-dimensional data like browser characteristics and device information, then reporting them as user identifiers.
