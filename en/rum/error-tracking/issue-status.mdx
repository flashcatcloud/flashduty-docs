In Error Tracking, all Issues have a status that helps you categorize and prioritize problems.

## Status Types

| Status | Identifier | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **For Review** | `for_review` | New issues or regressions that need attention |
| **Reviewed** | `reviewed` | Categorized issues that need fixing, can be handled immediately or later |
| **Ignored** | `ignored` | Issues that don't require further investigation or handling |
| **Resolved** | `resolved` | Issues that have been fixed and are no longer occurring |

<Info>
All newly discovered Issues have an initial status of **For Review (for_review)**. Flashduty automatically updates status based on specific conditions, and you can also manually adjust it.
</Info>

## Auto-resolve Issues

Flashduty automatically marks inactive or resolved Issues as **Resolved (resolved)**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Version-based Auto-resolve">
    If the last reported version of an Issue is more than 14 days old and the error hasn't reappeared in newer versions, the system will automatically resolve it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Time-based Auto-resolve">
    If the `version` tag is not set, when an Issue has no new error reports in the past 14 days, the system will automatically resolve it.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Properly configuring your application's `version` tag is crucial for accurately identifying resolved Issues.
</Tip>

## Auto-reopen Issues

Flashduty has Issue detection capability. When a resolved Issue reappears, the system automatically reopens it and marks it as **For Review (for_review)** status, while recording the event as "Regression" in the activity timeline.

### What is Regression?

Regression refers to previously fixed problems unexpectedly reappearing after code updates. Flashduty's regression detection automatically identifies these situations, reopening related Issues instead of creating duplicate Issues, thereby preserving the complete context and history of the problem.

### Regression Detection Mechanism

<Warning>
Regression detection is triggered when any of the following conditions are met:
- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears in an updated version of the code
- If a **Resolved (resolved)** error reappears when no version tag is set
</Warning>

Once regression is detected, Flashduty will:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Change Status">
    Automatically change the Issue status to **For Review (for_review)**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Label">
    Add a **Regression** label to the Issue for quick identification
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Associated Version Configuration

Regression detection considers the service version information when the error occurred. Detection is only triggered in new versions after the Issue is marked as **Resolved (resolved)**.

```javascript
window.FLASHCAT_RUM.init({
  applicationId: "rum-application-id",
  environment: "production",
  version: "1.0.0", // Ensure correct version number is set
});
```

<Note>
If no version tag is set, when a resolved Issue has errors again, the system will still mark it as "Regression", but cannot determine if it occurred in a new version.
</Note>

## Manually Update Status

You can manually update Issue status anywhere Issues are displayed, including the Issue list or details panel.

<Frame caption="Manually Update Issue Status">
  <img src="https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/a57c54a6a28915dec4480a9db9411e30.png" alt="Manually Update Status" style={{maxWidth: "600px", margin: "0 auto", display: "block"}} />
</Frame>

Simply click the current status and select the new status from the dropdown menu.

## Best Practices
