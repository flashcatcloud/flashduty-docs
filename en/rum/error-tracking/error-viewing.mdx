## Issue Information Overview

</Frame>

Each entry listed in the Issue browser contains the following information:

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Error type and error message | Core identifying information of the Issue |
| File path where error occurred | Locate error source |
| Service name | Associated service |
| Error cause | System-inferred possible root cause |
| Whether issue has regressed | Indicates if a resolved issue has reappeared |
| First and last occurrence time | Issue lifecycle information |
| Occurrence count chart | Trend over time |
| Occurrence count in selected time period | Statistical data |

## Issue Status

Issues have 4 statuses, with transitions as follows:

</Frame>

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **For Review** | Newly discovered issues that need attention |
| **Reviewed** | Confirmed issues being fixed |
| **Resolved** | Issues that have been fixed |
| **Ignored** | Issues that don't need handling |

<Tip>
For regression-related transition logic, please refer to [Issue Status](./issue-status).
</Tip>

## Filtering and Sorting

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Time Range">
    The timeline in the upper right corner of the browser allows you to display Issues that had errors during the selected time period. You can:
    
    - Select a preset range from the dropdown menu
    - Directly modify the time
    - Enter natural language for filtering
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Sort Options">
    | Sort Option | Description |
    |-------------|-------------|
    | Update Time | Sort by issue update time (default) |
    | Create Time | Sort by first discovery time |
    | Occurrence Count | Sort by total error occurrences in selected time range |
    | Affected Sessions | Sort by number of affected RUM sessions |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Filters">
    Flashduty RUM automatically indexes predefined attributes for your Issues and creates corresponding filters.

    <Frame>
      <img src="https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/imges/png/718ff0527731fd89465a3a7e0fb7c7ea.png" alt="Filters" />
    </Frame>

    Supported attributes include:

    | Attribute | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | Error Cause | Possible root cause type when error occurred |
    | Environment | The env field when Issue was reported |
    | Service | The service field when Issue was reported |
    | Error Type | The error.type field in the reported error event |
    | Error Message | The error.message field in the error event, supports fuzzy matching |
    | Issue ID | ID when Issue was grouped, multiple IDs can be separated by commas |
    | Regression | If a resolved issue occurs again, the Issue will be marked as regressed |
    | Fingerprint | Fingerprint information when Issue was grouped, multiple fingerprints can be separated by commas |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Error Cause Classification

Flashcat adds an error cause classification to each Issue when created, helping improve fault localization efficiency.

| Error Cause | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Code Error | Errors caused by code defects |
| Illegal Object Access | Code accessed a null or undefined object |
| Invalid Parameter | Function called with invalid parameters |
| Network Error | Server response too slow or poor network speed |
| API Request Failed | API endpoint returned an error status code |
| Unknown Error | Unable to locate this error type |

<Tip>
When hovering over an error cause classification, the system will use AI capabilities to provide inferred root causes and fix suggestions.
</Tip>

## Regression

Regression refers to previously fixed bugs reappearing.

</Frame>

<Warning>
If an error is marked as resolved but the same error occurs later (with a different version), the Issue status will be reopened from the closed state and marked as "Regression".
</Warning>

## Issue Details

Click any Issue to open the details panel and view more information.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    The top of the panel displays basic Issue information, such as status and error cause. You can also understand the Issue lifecycle: first and last occurrence dates, duration, and error occurrence count over time (aggregated by time granularity).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Label Distribution">
    In the label distribution section, you can view the proportion of different labels under this Issue across various dimensions, quickly determining the impact scope and helping locate root causes.

    Currently supports labels like `view_name`, `browser_name`, `version`, `env`, etc.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Sample">
    By default, displays the most recent error information reported during the Issue's occurrence as an error sample. You can also switch through the navigation bar.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Stack">
    View error context and stack information. If source code has been uploaded, you can see the stack information when the error occurred.
