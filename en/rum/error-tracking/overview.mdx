## Error Tracking Workflow

RUM error tracking consists of two key phases: **Problem Discovery** and **Problem Localization**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Problem Discovery">
    Quickly discovering error trigger points is the first step in diagnosis. RUM provides the following ways to help you identify problems:

    - **Data Analysis**: View error rates, error types, and other data trends through the "Errors" tab in the **Analytics Dashboard**
    - **Alert Notifications**: By enabling alerts in the application and linking with **channels**, you can be notified immediately when errors occur
    - **Active Inspection**: Observe error trends in the **Error Tracking** module, such as JavaScript errors, network errors, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Localization">
    RUM provides rich error data and contextual information to help you precisely locate the root cause.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Core Error Data

| Error Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| JavaScript Errors | Runtime errors, syntax errors, etc. |
| Network Request Errors | API call failures, timeouts, etc. |
| Resource Loading Errors | Image, script, and other resource loading failures |
| Framework-related Errors | Component errors in React, Vue, and other frameworks |

### Contextual Information

- **User Environment**: Browser type, device model, operating system
- **Error Stack**: Detailed call stack information
- **Session Timeline**: Operation path that triggered the error

### Problem Classification and Localization

| Problem Type | Typical Symptoms | Possible Causes | Key Metrics |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **JavaScript Errors** | Feature failure, console errors | Code logic errors, browser compatibility issues | Error rate, error type |
| **Network Request Errors** | Request timeout, connection interruption | Slow API response, poor network quality | Request latency, connection success rate |
| **Resource Loading Errors** | Image/script loading failure | CDN configuration errors, incorrect resource paths | Resource loading failure rate |
| **Framework-related Errors** | Component rendering failure | Component logic errors, state management issues | Component error rate |

## Problem Localization Tools
