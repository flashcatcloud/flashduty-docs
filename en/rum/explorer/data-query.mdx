---

The Flashduty RUM Explorer provides powerful search capabilities, allowing you to quickly locate and analyze RUM data through flexible query syntax. Queries consist of **terms** and **operators**, supporting complex search condition combinations.

## Query Basics

Queries support two types of terms:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Single term** | Single word | `test`, `hello` |
| **Phrase** | Word group surrounded by double quotes | `"hello flashduty"` |

### Boolean Operators

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `AND` | Intersection: both terms must be in the selected view (default operator) | `error AND timeout` |
| `OR` | Union: either term is included in the selected view, must be wrapped with `()` | `(error OR warning)` |
| `-` | Exclusion: the following term is not in the view | `error -timeout` |

## Full-Text Search

<Warning>
Full-text search is only supported for some fields. If no results are found, please switch to field queries.
</Warning>

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `hello` | Exact match for `hello` |
| `hello*` | Match fields starting with `hello` |
| `*hello` | Match fields ending with `hello` |
| `*hello*` | Match fields containing `hello` |
| `"hello world"` | Exact match for `"hello world"` |

## Escape Special Characters

When searching for field values containing special characters, use backslash `\` to escape or use double quotes.

<Note>
The following characters are considered special: `:`, `"`, `*`, `-`, `>`, `<`, `,`, `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `\` and space
</Note>

## Attribute Search

Use `attribute:term` syntax to search for specific attributes:

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `browser_name:Chrome` | Search for browser with value `Chrome` |
| `view_name:*/detail` | Search for view names ending with `/detail` |
| `-resource_status_code:0` | Search for resources with status code not `0` |
| `os_name:"Mac OS X"` | Search for OS name with value `"Mac OS X"` |

## Numeric Search

For numeric type attributes, comparison operators can be used:

| Query | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `session_error_count:>5` | Search for sessions with error count greater than `5` |
| `view_time_spent:>=1.00min` | Search for views with time spent greater than `1min` |
| `session_view_count:[2 TO 8]` | Search for sessions with view count between `2` and `8` |

## Complex Search Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Error Analysis">
    Search for Warning type errors occurring on the wallet page:

    ```
    error_message:Warning\:* view_url_path:/wallet/*
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Performance Analysis">
    Search for views with loading time over 5 seconds and starting with `/incident/detail/`:

    ```
    view_loading_time:>=5s view_url_path:/incident/detail/*
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Error Requests">
    Search for resources with request type `fetch` or `xhr` and status code not `200`:

    ```
    -resource_status_code:200 resource_type:(fetch OR xhr)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Page Behavior">
    Search for views with URL `/incident` and action count greater than `2` or error count greater than `3`:

    ```
    view_url_path:/incident (view_action_count:>=2 OR view_error_count:>=3)
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
