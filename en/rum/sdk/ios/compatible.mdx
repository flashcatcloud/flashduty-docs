| **tvOS** | ✅ Fully supported | 12.0+ | All features fully supported |
| **macOS (Designed for iPad)** | ✅ Supported | 11.0+ | iPad apps running on macOS |
| **macOS (Catalyst)** | ⚠️ Partial support | 10.14+ | Build supported, some runtime features may be limited |
| **macOS** | ⚠️ Partial support | 10.14+ | Unofficial support, some features may not work properly |
| **visionOS** | ⚠️ Partial support | 1.0+ | Unofficial support, some features may not work properly |
| **watchOS** | ❌ Not supported | - | watchOS platform not currently supported |

## Development Toolchain

### Xcode

<Note>
The SDK is built with the latest version of Xcode but is always backward compatible with the minimum supported Xcode version required for App Store submission.
</Note>

**Recommended Version:** Xcode 14.0 and above

### Dependency Management Tools

| Tool | Support Status | Recommendation |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| **Swift Package Manager** | ✅ Fully supported | Recommended ⭐ |
| **CocoaPods** | ✅ Fully supported | Supported |
| Carthage | 🚧 Planned | Coming soon |

### Programming Languages

| Language | Min Version | Support Status |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Swift** | 5.0+ | ✅ Fully supported (recommended) |
| **Objective-C** | 2.0 | ✅ Fully supported |

## Framework Compatibility

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="UI Frameworks">

| Framework | Auto Tracking | Manual Tracking | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **UIKit** | ✅ | ✅ | Supports auto tracking of UIViewController and user interactions |
| **SwiftUI** | ⚠️ | ✅ | Requires `.trackRUMView()` and `.trackRUMTapAction()` modifiers |

<Tip>
UIKit apps can be fully auto-tracked, SwiftUI apps require adding modifiers.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Frameworks">

| Framework/Library | Auto Tracking | Manual Tracking | Notes |
|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **URLSession** | ✅ | ✅ | Requires enabling `URLSessionInstrumentation` |
| **Alamofire** | ❌ | ✅ | Can be manually tracked via custom interceptor |
| **Apollo GraphQL** | ❌ | ✅ | Can be manually tracked via custom interceptor |
| **AFNetworking** | ❌ | ⚠️ | Deprecated, recommend migrating to URLSession |

<Note>
URLSession is recommended for fully automatic network request tracking.
</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="WebView Support">

| Type | Support Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| **WKWebView** | ✅ Fully supported | Requires integrating `FlashcatWebViewTracking` module |
| **UIWebView** | ❌ Not supported | Deprecated by Apple |

<Warning>
UIWebView has been deprecated by Apple, please use WKWebView.
</Warning>
</Accordion>

## SDK Modules

Flashduty iOS SDK consists of the following modules:

| Dependency Name (SPM/CocoaPods) | Import Name | Description | Required |
|---------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **FlashcatCore** | `DatadogCore` | Core SDK, provides basic functionality | ✅ Required |
| **FlashcatRUM** | `DatadogRUM` | RUM data collection and reporting | ✅ Required |
| **FlashcatWebViewTracking** | `DatadogWebViewTracking` | WebView integration support | Optional |
| **FlashcatCrashReporting** | `DatadogCrashReporting` | Crash reporting | Recommended |

<Tip>
Selectively integrate modules based on your needs. Only `FlashcatCore` and `FlashcatRUM` are required.
</Tip>

## Third-party Dependencies

<Note>
Flashduty iOS SDK depends on the following third-party libraries:
</Note>

| Library Name | Version | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| PLCrashReporter | 1.12.0 | Crash report collection |

## Known Limitations

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="SwiftUI Limitations">

- SwiftUI views require manually adding `.trackRUMView()` modifier to be tracked
- Using `.trackRUMTapAction()` inside `List` may affect default gesture behavior
- For `List` elements, recommend using custom action API

<Tip>
SwiftUI apps are recommended to combine auto tracking and manual tracking for best monitoring results.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="macOS and visionOS Limitations">

<Warning>
**Unofficial Support Platforms:**
- macOS and visionOS are not officially supported platforms
- Some features that depend on UIKit may not work properly on these platforms
- Future version compatibility is not guaranteed
</Warning>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Catalyst Limitations">

- Catalyst mode only supports building, some runtime features may be limited
- Recommend thorough testing before actual use

<Note>
If your app primarily targets macOS Catalyst, recommend verifying all features in a test environment first.
</Note>
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Minimum Deployment Requirements

<Check>
**Requirements:**
- Minimum OS version: iOS 12.0 / iPadOS 12.0 / tvOS 12.0
- Minimum Xcode version: Xcode 14.0
- Minimum Swift version: Swift 5.0
- Network permission: App needs network access permission to report data
- Storage space: SDK needs small amount of local storage for caching offline data
</Check>

## Performance Impact

Flashduty iOS SDK is designed to be lightweight with minimal impact on app performance:

| Metric | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **CPU Usage** | < 1% |
| **Memory Usage** | < 10 MB |
| **Package Size Increase** | ~2-3 MB (depending on integrated modules) |
| **Startup Time Impact** | < 100ms |

<Tip>
The SDK uses asynchronous batch processing and does not block the main thread, with minimal impact on user experience.
</Tip>

## Version Update Strategy

The SDK follows Semantic Versioning:

| Update Type | Version Format | Compatibility | Description |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Major** | v3.0.0 | May be incompatible | May contain breaking changes, code adjustments required |
| **Minor** | v3.1.0 | Backward compatible | New features, maintains backward compatibility |
| **Patch** | v3.1.1 | Fully compatible | Bug fixes, fully backward compatible |

<Tip>
We recommend regularly updating the SDK to the latest stable version for best performance and security.
</Tip>
