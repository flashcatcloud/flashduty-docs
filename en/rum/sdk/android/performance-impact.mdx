## Overview

When integrating any SDK into an Android application, understanding its performance impact is crucial for maintaining a good user experience. The Flashcat RUM SDK is designed with performance in mind and provides transparent measurement data to help you make informed integration decisions.

<Check>
The SDK uses asynchronous processing and batch reporting mechanisms to avoid blocking the main thread, ensuring it does not affect the application's UI responsiveness.
</Check>

## Performance Benchmark

To evaluate the actual performance impact of the SDK on your application, we conducted performance benchmarks under typical usage scenarios. The following SDK modules were enabled during testing:

- `fc-sdk-android-rum`: RUM core functionality
- `fc-sdk-android-trace`: Distributed tracing
- `fc-sdk-android-okhttp`: Network request tracking

The SDK was initialized with default configuration and simulated common user operations (such as page views, scrolling lists, network requests, etc.).

### Test Results

| Metric | With SDK | Without SDK | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Peak CPU Usage | ~27% | ~25% | +2% |
| Peak Memory Usage | ~435 MB | ~437 MB | Negligible |
| App Launch Time | ~245 ms | ~230 ms | +15 ms |
| APK Size | +500 KB | - | ~0.5 MB |
| Network Usage | ~70 KB sent / ~20 KB received | - | Varies with event volume |

<Note>
The above data are reference values under typical scenarios; actual impact may vary depending on application complexity, device performance, and SDK configuration.
</Note>

### Performance Impact Details

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CPU Usage" icon="microchip">
The SDK's CPU impact primarily comes from:

- Event collection and processing
- Data batching and compression
- Network request reporting

The SDK uses asynchronous processing and batch reporting mechanisms to avoid blocking the main thread, ensuring it does not affect the application's UI responsiveness.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Memory Usage" icon="memory">
The SDK uses a fixed-size memory buffer to store pending event data, which does not grow indefinitely over time. Stale data is automatically cleaned up to ensure it does not consume excessive memory.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Launch Time" icon="rocket">
The SDK initialization process is optimized, with launch time impact controlled to milliseconds.

<Tip>
It is recommended to initialize the SDK as early as possible in `Application.onCreate()` to capture the complete application startup process.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="APK Size" icon="box">
The SDK uses a modular design, allowing you to include only the necessary functional modules:

| Module | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `fc-sdk-android-rum` | RUM core functionality |
| `fc-sdk-android-trace` | Distributed tracing |
| `fc-sdk-android-okhttp` | OkHttp network tracking |
| `fc-sdk-android-webview` | WebView tracking |

Including only the necessary modules can minimize the impact on APK size.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Network Usage" icon="wifi">
The SDK employs the following strategies to optimize network usage:

- **Batch reporting**: Events are cached locally first and sent in batches to reduce the number of network requests
- **Data compression**: Reported data is compressed to reduce transmission traffic
- **Intelligent scheduling**: Upload timing is intelligently scheduled based on network status and battery level
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

If you have specific performance requirements, consider the following optimization measures:

<Steps>
<Step title="Adjust Sampling Rate">
Reduce the number of collected events by configuring the sampling rate:

```kotlin
val rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)
    .setSessionSampleRate(80f) // Sample 80% of sessions
    .build()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Features on Demand">
Only enable necessary tracking features:

```kotlin
val rumConfig = RumConfiguration.Builder(applicationId)
    .trackUserInteractions(false) // Disable user interaction tracking
    .trackLongTasks(false) // Disable long task tracking
    .build()
```
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Upload Strategy">
Adjust batch upload size and frequency to optimize network usage based on your application's needs.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Offline Data Storage

When the device is offline, the SDK stores data locally with strict storage space limits:

<Check>
- Uses fixed-size disk cache
- Expired data is automatically cleaned up
- Cached data will not affect device storage space
</Check>
