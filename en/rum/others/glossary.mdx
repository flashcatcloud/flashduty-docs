## Core Concepts

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **RUM (Real User Monitoring)** | RUM (Real User Monitor) helps developers understand actual user experience and optimize application performance by collecting and analyzing performance data from real users using websites or applications |
| **Session** | Sessions are the core unit of RUM data aggregation, used to analyze user journeys and experiences |
| **View** | Views record page load times, resource requests, etc., core to performance monitoring |
| **Action** | Used to analyze user behavior, measuring interaction performance and frustration points (such as "rage clicks") in user experience |
| **Resource** | Analyze resource loading times and performance to optimize page load speed |
| **Error** | Used to monitor frontend stability and identify errors affecting user experience |
| **Long Task** | RUM captures long tasks to identify performance bottlenecks causing page stuttering or poor user experience |
| **Pageview** | Pageviews are the basic unit of RUM data, used to analyze the performance of specific pages |
| **Issue** | Issues are the core of error management, used to aggregate similar errors, prioritize problems, and combine context to help developers quickly locate and fix issues |

## Performance Metrics

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Core Web Vitals** | RUM monitors these metrics to evaluate webpage loading and interaction performance |
| **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** | Measures page loading performance, recording the time when the main content of the page finishes loading |
| **FID (First Input Delay)** | Measures page interaction performance, recording the delay from when a user first interacts with the page to when the browser responds |
| **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** | Measures page visual stability, recording unexpected layout shifts that occur during page loading |
| **TTFB (Time to First Byte)** | Measures server response speed, recording the time from when the request is sent to when the first byte is received |

## Data Analysis

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Facet** | Facilitates building queries in RUM Explorer to analyze behavior of specific user groups |
| **Attribute** | Provides context and enhances data analysis flexibility |
| **Global Context** | Enhances customization capabilities for RUM data analysis |
