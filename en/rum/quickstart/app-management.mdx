## Overview

A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data, used to collect, store, and analyze real user experience data from frontend applications. An application represents a monitored frontend project, which can be a website, mobile app, or single-page application.

<Tip>
We recommend creating RUM applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce store, admin dashboard, etc.
</Tip>

Each application has its own unique `applicationId` and `clientToken`, used to identify data sources and ensure data security. After the application is created, you need to integrate the SDK into your frontend code to start data collection and monitoring.

## Application Permissions

To meet the data security requirements of different business scenarios, RUM applications provide flexible access level settings:

| Access Level | Visibility | Applicable Scenarios |
|--------------|------------|----------------------|
| **Public** | Visible to all users in the account, can view data and handle Issues | General business applications |
| **Private** | Only visible to creator, account administrator, and owner account | Sensitive business data |

<Note>
In private applications, if other members need to view content, they can be temporarily authorized to access it by sharing the incident link.
</Note>

## Create Application

</Frame>

You can quickly create an application through the RUM product guide page:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select Application Type">
Select the frontend technology type corresponding to the application, currently supporting **JavaScript (JS)、Android、iOS**.
</Step>

<Step title="Set Management Team">
Specify the management team for this application.

<Warning>
Team members have full operational permissions for this application, non-team members only have read-only access to the configuration of this application.
</Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Geo-information">
By default, automatic collection of user geo-location data is enabled. To disable automatic collection of client IP or geo-location data, turn off the geo-information collection switch.

See [Data Collection](/en/rum/others/data-collection).
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Alerts">
By default, alert notifications are automatically enabled to facilitate timely handling of errors.

See [Issue Alerts](/en/rum/error-tracking/issue-alerts).
</Step>
</Steps>

## SDK Configuration

></video>

You can modify parameters and preview the initialization code in real-time in **Application Configuration > SDK Configuration** to quickly integrate the SDK.

<Warning>
Modifying SDK configuration in application management will not take effect in real-time on integrated clients. All configuration changes need to be updated in your frontend code and redeployed to take effect.
</Warning>

### Service Definition

A service is an independent, deployable code repository that maps to a set of pages.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Monolithic Application">
If your application is built as a whole, your RUM application only needs one service name.

```javascript
flashcatRum.init({
  applicationId: 'YOUR_APP_ID',
  clientToken: 'YOUR_CLIENT_TOKEN',
  service: 'my-web-app'  // Single service name
});
```
</Tab>

<Tab title="Micro-frontend/Multi-page Application">
If your browser application is built from multiple independent repositories, set different service names for different modules.

```javascript
// Main application
flashcatRum.init({
  service: 'main-app'
});

// Sub-application A
flashcatRum.init({
  service: 'module-a'
});
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
