## Quick Start

Using Flashduty RUM requires just a few simple steps to start monitoring your frontend application performance.

### Basic Flow

### Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Create RUM Application">
A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data. We recommend creating applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce store, admin dashboard, etc.

1. Go to the RUM application list page, click **Create RUM Application**
2. Enter the application name, management team, access level, and alert configuration
3. Click confirm to create

<Tip>
Go to [Application Management](/en/rum/quickstart/app-management) to learn more configuration options.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate SDK">
After creating the RUM application, you need to integrate the SDK into your application.

1. Get SDK integration configuration information on the application details page
2. Choose the appropriate integration method based on your application type

<CodeGroup>
```html CDN Import
<script src="https://static.flashcat.cloud/browser-sdk/v0/flashcat-rum.js"></script>
<script>
  window.FC_RUM && window.FC_RUM.init({
    applicationId: 'Your Application ID',
    clientToken: 'Your Client Token',
    service: '<SERVICE_NAME>',
    env: '<ENV_NAME>',
    version: '1.0.0'
  });
</script>
```

```javascript npm Import
import { flashcatRum } from '@flashcatcloud/browser-rum';

flashcatRum.init({
  applicationId: 'Your Application ID',
  clientToken: 'Your Client Token',
  service: '<SERVICE_NAME>',
  env: '<ENV_NAME>',
  version: '1.0.0'
});
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Go to [SDK Documentation](/en/rum/sdk/web/sdk-integration) to learn detailed configuration options.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Data Reporting">
After SDK integration is complete, the system will automatically collect the following data:

- **Page Performance Metrics**: Load time, first screen time, etc.
- **Resource Loading Performance**: JS, CSS, images, and other resources
- **User Behavior Data**: Clicks, scrolls, and other interactions
- **Errors and Exceptions**: JavaScript exceptions, network errors
- **Network Request Performance**: API call duration and status

<Check>
Data usually appears in the console within 2-5 minutes.
</Check>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Feature Experience

In the RUM console, you can use the following features:

<CardGroup cols={2}>

</Card>

<Card title="Error Tracking" icon="bug" href="/en/rum/error-tracking/overview">
  Monitor JavaScript exceptions, quickly locate root causes
</Card>

<Card title="Session Replay" icon="video" href="/en/rum/session-replay/overview">

</Card>

<Card title="Data Query" icon="magnifying-glass" href="/en/rum/explorer/overview">

</Card>
</CardGroup>

### Subscription Information

<Info>
The RUM service is currently in a whitelist beta phase, and all features are completely free. After the beta ends, we will notify you in advance to switch to a formal subscription or cancel the trial.

After official launch, RUM will be charged based on Session volume, with a certain amount of free quota provided.
