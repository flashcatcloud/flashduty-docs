### Integration Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Create RUM Application">
A RUM application is a container for frontend performance monitoring data. We recommend creating applications based on business systems or applications, such as: official website, e-commerce store, admin dashboard, etc.

1. Go to the RUM application list page, click **Create RUM Application**
2. Enter the application name, management team, access level, and alert configuration
3. Click confirm to create

<Tip>
Go to [Application Management](/en/rum/quickstart/app-management) to learn more configuration options.
</Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Integrate SDK">
After creating the RUM application, you need to integrate the SDK into your application.

1. Get SDK integration configuration information on the application details page
2. Choose the appropriate integration guide based on your application type

</Card>
</CardGroup>
</Step>

<Step title="Verify Data Reporting">
After SDK integration is complete, the system will automatically collect the following data:

- **Page Performance Metrics**: Load time, first screen time, etc.
- **Resource Loading Performance**: JS, CSS, images, and other resources
- **User Behavior Data**: Clicks, scrolls, and other interactions
- **Errors and Exceptions**: JavaScript exceptions, network errors
- **Network Request Performance**: API call duration and status

Data usually appears in the console within 2-5 minutes.
