## 2025

### 2025-12-30 | 🗓 Flashduty Status Page: Service Down, Trust Online

<Badge>New</Badge>

Service interruptions are inevitable, but trust shouldn't go offline with them. Flashduty Status Page is designed to break the information opacity barrier:

**Reduce Repetitive Tickets at the Source**

Instead of responding passively, let information lead the way. The status page provides users with service status they can check anytime, while supporting subscription to service updates. When an incident occurs, the latest progress is automatically pushed to subscribers.

**Make Service Maintenance Transparent and Controllable**

The status page not only reports unexpected incidents but also makes planned maintenance crystal clear. By announcing maintenance windows in advance, users can clearly understand the timing and scope of service adjustments.

**Prove Stability with Data**

The status page automatically accumulates historical availability data, transforming abstract SLA commitments into intuitive, verifiable uptime records.

Go to **Flashduty Console → On-call → Status Page** to try it out.

**1. Name Mapping Auto-routing Support**
