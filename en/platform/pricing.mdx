## FAQ

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does On-call calculate active users?">
    Users who use commercial features within the month are counted as active users. At the end of each monthly cycle:
    - Fixed Licenses remain valid
    - Temporary Licenses are automatically released
    - When a member is deleted, their License is automatically released
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What can members without a License do?">
    - **Can**: Passively receive alert messages, share tenant notification quota
    - **Cannot**: View/handle incidents, perform any platform configuration operations
    
    In escalation rules, you can choose to notify members without a License about incidents, but they cannot perform any operations on the incident.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are RUM sessions calculated?">
    - **Session Analysis**: Each complete session of a user visiting the application, including page views, resource loads, errors, etc.
    - **Session Replay**: Sessions that record user behavior for replaying user interactions
    
    Both are billed independently based on the actual number of sessions generated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is private deployment supported?">
    Yes. Flashduty offers a private deployment version that is nearly identical to the SaaS service.
    
    <Warning>
    Private deployment has higher maintenance costs and a different pricing model than SaaS. Unless you have specific requirements, we recommend using the cloud service.
    </Warning>
    
    Please contact us if you need the private deployment version.
