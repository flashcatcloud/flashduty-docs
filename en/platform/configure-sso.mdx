description: Sign in once and access multiple connected applications through single sign-on, improving work efficiency and enhancing security
---

Flashduty supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML2.0, OIDC, CAS, and LDAP (private deployment only) protocols, helping you easily integrate with various applications and platforms. Users only need to sign in once to access multiple connected applications and services without repeated authentication.

## Configuring SAML Protocol

| Metadata Document | XML document obtained from the identity provider |
| Field Mapping | Flashduty extracts user email, username, and phone information from the identity provider through mapped fields |
| Login Domain | An important identifier for identity recognition, globally unique |
| Create Account on Sign In | Enabled by default; when disabled, members must be invited before they can sign in |
| Flashduty Service Provider Info | **Service Provider Metadata** and **Assertion Consumer Service URL** (assertion address for identity provider to call for single sign-on) |

| Flashduty Service Provider Info | **Redirect URL**: Identity provider callback address<br />**Supported Signing Algorithms**: RS256, RS384, RS512, ES256, ES384, ES512, PS256, PS384, PS512 (HS256 not supported)<br />**Requested Scopes**: openid, email, phone |

## Configuring CAS Protocol

---

**Configuration path**: Platform Management → Single Sign-On → Enable → Settings → Select CAS protocol type

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol Type | Select CAS protocol |
| CAS Address | CAS service address obtained from identity provider |
| CAS Login Path | CAS login path |
| Field Mapping | Flashduty extracts user email, username, and phone information from the identity provider through mapped fields |
| Login Domain | An important identifier for identity recognition, globally unique |
| Create Account on Sign In | Enabled by default; when disabled, members must be invited before they can sign in |
| Flashduty Service Provider Info | **Redirect URL**: Identity provider callback address |

## Configuring LDAP Protocol

---

<Note>
LDAP single sign-on is only supported in the **private deployment version**.
</Note>

**Configuration path**: Platform Management → Single Sign-On → Enable → Settings → Select LDAP protocol type

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Protocol Type | Select LDAP protocol |
| LDAP URL | LDAP service address, e.g., `ldap://10.10.10.10:389` |
| BIND DN | Username for connecting to LDAP, e.g., `cn=admin,dc=flashduty,dc=com` |
| BIND DN Password | Password for connecting to LDAP, stored encrypted in the database |
| TLS | Skip Verify during TLS sign in |
| StartTLS | Whether to enable StartTLS |
| User DN | Defines where to start searching for users, e.g., `ou=people,dc=flashduty,dc=com` |
| Auth Filter | Custom filter expression for retrieving user DN information, basic form: `(&(mail=%s))`. Note: Opening and closing parentheses are required |
| Field Mapping | Flashduty extracts user email, username, and phone information from the identity provider through mapped fields; email is a required mapping field |
| Login Domain | An important identifier for identity recognition, globally unique |
| Create Account on Sign In | Enabled by default; when disabled, members must be invited before they can sign in |

<Tip>
Field mapping must be consistent with the identity provider configuration, otherwise it will cause errors. For specific configuration, refer to [OpenLDAP Integration Guide](/en/on-call/integration/sso/openldap).
