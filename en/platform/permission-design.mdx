keywords: ["permission design", "RBAC", "functional permissions", "data permissions", "role management"]
---

Flashduty uses two types of permissions: **functional permissions** and **data permissions**, which work together in different feature scenarios.

<Warning>
You must have both **functional permissions** and **data permissions** to operate on certain data objects. Functional permissions are a prerequisite, determining whether you can perform a certain type of operation; data permissions further define the scope of data you can operate on.
</Warning>

## Functional Permissions

<Note>
Functional permissions, also known as operational permissions, determine which system features or operations a user can access. This includes: whether APIs can be called, whether buttons are clickable, and whether pages and menus are visible.
</Note>

Flashduty **controls functional permissions based on roles (RBAC)**, with permissions divided by modules for fine-grained management. The system provides the following preset roles (you can also create custom roles):

### Preset Roles

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Admin" icon="user-shield">
    Has all permissions. Suitable for core members who need complete management capabilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Responder" icon="headset">
    Has all permissions except "Payment Center", "Members Manage", "Roles Manage", and "SSO Manage". Suitable for members handling daily operations work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    Has most read-only permissions except "Audit" and "Onboarding". Suitable for members who only need to view data.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
The **Responder** role does not include member management and role management permissions. To manage team members or assign roles, use the **Admin** role.
</Tip>

### Permission List

The system divides permissions by modules, with each permission point having **Read** and **Manage** types.

## Data Permissions

<Note>
Data permissions, also known as access permissions, control the scope of data a user can access or view.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Functional permissions are a prerequisite for data permissions.** You must first have the corresponding functional permissions for data permissions to take effect. For example: a member with the **Viewer** role belongs to Team A, and a channel belongs to Team A and is set to private. Although the member has data permissions to access this channel, since **Viewer** does not have channel management functional permissions, they can only view but not edit.
</Warning>

Flashduty **controls data permissions based on teams**, applied in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Permission Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Team Management** | Creator, owner account, and team members can modify team information and manage team members |
| **Channels** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify channel basic information, noise reduction configuration, escalation rules, etc. |
| **Schedule Management** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify schedule basic information, rotation rules, etc. |
| **Template Management** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify template basic information, channel template configurations, etc. |
| **Service Calendar** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify calendar basic information, holiday settings, etc. |
| **Integration Management** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can manage integration configurations |
| **Mapping Rules** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can manage mapping rule configurations |

When you don't have data permissions for a resource, the system will display the following message:

</Frame>

## Legacy Role Migration

<Warning>
The following legacy preset roles were deprecated on **January 30, 2026**, and the system has automatically completed the migration.
</Warning>

### Legacy Role Description

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Account.Admin` | Account Administrator, originally had all operational permissions |
| `Fin.Admin` | Financial Administrator, originally had payment center ordering permissions |
| `Tech.Admin` | Technical Administrator, originally had access control and audit permissions (including member management) |

### Migration Mapping

| Original Role | New Role | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Account.Admin` | **Admin** | Permissions unchanged |
| `Fin.Admin` | **Admin** | Permissions elevated |
| `Tech.Admin` | **Responder** | Member management permissions removed |
| No role | **Responder** | Automatically granted |
| Custom role | Unchanged | May lose some Monitors permissions, please check |

### Compatibility Notes

The following scenarios will automatically grant the **Viewer** role to ensure members have basic access permissions:

- When [inviting new members via Open API](https://developer-en.flashcat.cloud/en/flashduty/members/invite) without specifying a role
- When automatically creating members through **Single Sign-On (SSO)** without specifying a role

<Warning>
**Compatibility period ends: June 30, 2026**

After this date, API requests without specifying a role will return an error. Please complete the adaptation in advance.
</Warning>

<Tip>
Users with custom roles should check their permission configuration after the upgrade to ensure it meets expectations.
