description: Learn about Flashduty's role-based (RBAC) functional permissions and team-based data permissions design
---

Flashduty uses two types of permissions: **functional permissions** and **data permissions**, which work together in different feature scenarios.

<Warning>
You must have both functional permissions and data permissions to operate on certain data objects.
</Warning>

## Functional Permissions

---

<Note>
Functional permissions, also known as operational permissions, determine which system features or operations a user can access.
</Note>

Flashduty **controls functional permissions based on roles (RBAC)**. The system provides the following preset roles (you can also create custom roles):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account.Admin - Account Administrator" icon="user-shield">
    Has all operational permissions except modifying owner information. Can assist the owner account in managing daily affairs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tech.Admin - Technical Administrator" icon="wrench">
    Has access control, audit logs, and all functional permissions not listed in the table below.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Fin.Admin - Financial Administrator" icon="credit-card">
    Has billing center ordering permissions and all functional permissions not listed in the table below.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Permission Matrix

| Permission | Account.Admin | Tech.Admin | Fin.Admin |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **API Key Management** | ✔️ | | |
| **Audit Log Reading** | ✔️ | ✔️ | |
| **Monitoring System Event Management** | ✔️ | | |
| **Custom Field Management** | ✔️ | ✔️ | |
| **Access Control** (Member management, role management, SSO management) | ✔️ | ✔️ | |
| **Plan Management** (Plan management, balance alerts, expiration policies, monitoring management) | ✔️ | | ✔️ |
| **All Other Features** | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |

<Tip>
**All other features** not listed in the table (such as managing channels) are default permissions available to all users and do not require role assignment.
</Tip>

## Data Permissions

---

<Note>
Data permissions, also known as access permissions, control the scope of data a user can access or view.
</Note>

Flashduty **controls data permissions based on teams**, applied in the following scenarios:

| Scenario | Permission Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Team Management** | Creator, owner account, and team members can modify team information and manage team members |
| **Channels** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify channel basic information, noise reduction configuration, escalation rules, etc. |
| **Schedule Management** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify schedule basic information, rotation rules, etc. |
| **Template Management** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify template basic information, channel template configurations, etc. |
| **Service Calendar** | Creator, owner account, and responsible team members can modify calendar basic information, holiday settings, etc. |

When you don't have data permissions for a resource, the system will display the following message:
