Open API is used to access and operate Flashduty entity data, such as viewing and managing configurations. Using the API is essentially the same as logging into the [Flashduty Console](https://console.flashcat.cloud) and performing operations through the UI.

<Tip>
If you want to push alerts from your custom monitoring system to Flashduty, please refer to [Custom Alert Events](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/alert-sources/flashcat).
</Tip>

## Request Specifications

---

### Request URL

All APIs only accept access via **HTTPS** protocol and have a single Endpoint:

```
https://api.flashcat.cloud
```

### Headers

Most requests use the POST method with JSON Payload parameters. Please ensure the correct Content-Type is set:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Character Encoding

All APIs use **UTF-8** encoding.

---

## Authentication

---

All Open APIs use **APP Key** for authentication.

### Obtaining an APP Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign in to console">
    Sign in to the [Flashduty Console](https://console.flashcat.cloud)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create APP Key">
    Go to **Account Settings → APP Key** page, enter a name, and click the Add button to complete creation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Each APP Key represents an independent user and has all the operational permissions of that user. Please keep it safe and avoid leakage.
</Warning>

### Usage Example

Pass the APP Key as a query string parameter:

```bash
https://api.flashcat.cloud/path?app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY
```

<RequestExample>
```bash cURL
curl -X POST 'https://api.flashcat.cloud/your/api/path?app_key=YOUR_APP_KEY' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"param": "value"}'
