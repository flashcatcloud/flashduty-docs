## Request Limits

---

### Rate Limits

To ensure service stability, APIs have rate limits on request frequency. When requests are too frequent, a `429` status code with `RequestTooFrequently` error will be returned.

<Warning>
Please control your request frequency reasonably and avoid sending a large number of requests in a short period. It is recommended to implement a retry mechanism with exponential backoff when receiving a 429 error.
</Warning>

### Permission Limits

- Each APP Key inherits all permissions from its creator
- When an operation exceeds permission scope, a `403` status code with `AccessDenied` error will be returned
- It is recommended to create separate APP Keys for different purposes, following the principle of least privilege

## Error Handling Recommendations

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="400 Parameter Error">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Missing required parameters
    - Incorrect parameter format
    - Content-Type not set to `application/json`
    
    **Solution**:
    Check request parameters and Headers settings, refer to API documentation for parameter requirements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="401 Authentication Failed">
    **Possible causes**:
    - APP Key not provided
    - APP Key is incorrect or has expired
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Confirm that the request URL contains the `app_key` parameter
    2. Go to the console to check if the APP Key is valid
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="403 Permission Denied">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Current user does not have permission to perform this operation
    - The user corresponding to the APP Key has insufficient permissions
    
    **Solution**:
    Contact the account administrator to elevate permissions, or use an APP Key with the appropriate permissions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="429 Too Many Requests">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Too many requests sent in a short period
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Reduce request frequency
    2. Implement exponential backoff retry mechanism
    3. Combine multiple requests (e.g., use batch APIs)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="500 Internal Error">
    **Possible causes**:
    - Server-side internal exception
    
    **Solution**:
    1. Retry later
    2. If the issue persists, contact technical support and provide the `request_id`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

---

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Implement Retry Mechanism" icon="rotate">
    For network errors and 5xx errors, it is recommended to implement exponential backoff retry with an initial interval of 1 second and a maximum of 3 retries.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Record request_id" icon="clipboard-list">
    Save the `request_id` returned from each request to facilitate troubleshooting and technical support.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Protect APP Key" icon="shield-check">
    Do not hardcode APP Key in client code. It is recommended to manage it through environment variables or configuration centers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rotate Keys Regularly" icon="key">
    Regularly replace APP Keys and promptly delete keys that are no longer in use to reduce the risk of leakage.
  </Card>
