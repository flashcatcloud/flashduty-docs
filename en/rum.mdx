## What is Real User Monitoring?

Real User Monitoring (RUM) is an innovative technology that tracks and analyzes the actual experience of real users when using your web application. Unlike traditional synthetic testing, RUM collects data directly from user browsers, giving you visibility into how your application performs in real-world environments.

Flashduty RUM enables developers, operations engineers, and business stakeholders to intuitively understand application performance, identify issues promptly, and continuously optimize user experience.
