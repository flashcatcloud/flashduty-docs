## What is Monitors?

Flashduty Monitors is a unified alert engine that integrates various metrics and log data sources. Based on your configured alert rules, it periodically queries data, performs threshold evaluation, and pushes generated alert events to Flashduty On-Call for aggregation and delivery.

<Tip>
Monitors can replace the alerting capabilities of products like Nightingale, vmalert, and elastalert, deeply integrated with the On-Call product to meet various complex alerting needs.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Architecture Design

Flashduty is a SaaS service that cannot directly access data sources within user private networks, so Monitors adopts an edge computing architecture:

<Steps>
  <Step title="SaaS Server">
    Responsible for managing alert rules, permission control, and alert event aggregation
  </Step>
  <Step title="monitedge Edge Node">
    Deployed within user private networks, syncs alert rules from SaaS, periodically queries data sources, and performs threshold evaluation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alert Push">
    When edge nodes generate alert events, they push them to the SaaS server for subsequent processing
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
If you have multiple datacenters, you can deploy independent monitedge instances in each datacenter, each responsible for alerting on data sources within their respective datacenter.
</Note>

## High Availability Deployment

Monitors supports cluster deployment to ensure high availability of the alert engine:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Single Datacenter Cluster" icon="server">
    Deploy multiple monitedge instances in the same datacenter, use the `--alerter.clusterName` parameter to set the same cluster name, and the system will automatically shard alert rule processing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Multi-datacenter Deployment" icon="globe">
    Deploy independent monitedge clusters in different datacenters, each cluster using a different cluster name to process their respective datacenter's data sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Failover" icon="shield">
    If an instance in the cluster fails, other instances will automatically take over its alert rules, ensuring high availability while avoiding duplicate alerts.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Alert Rule Types

| Type | Description | Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Threshold alert | Trigger when metric exceeds/falls below threshold | CPU, memory, disk, and other resource monitoring |
| Year-over-year alert | Trigger when deviation from historical same period exceeds threshold | Business volume, traffic anomaly detection |
| Period-over-period alert | Trigger when deviation from previous period exceeds threshold | Spike and drop detection |
| No-data alert | Trigger when metric stops reporting | Service liveness detection |
| Composite alert | Combined condition evaluation | Complex business scenarios |
