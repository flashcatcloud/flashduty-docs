<Accordion title="Alert rule execution is not as expected, how to debug?">
On the alert rules list page, there is a **Debug Log Switch** that you can enable. Afterwards, the alert engine process `monitedge` will output detailed execution logs for that rule, making it easier to troubleshoot.

`monitedge` outputs logs to standard output (`stdout`). The viewing method depends on the deployment method:

| Deployment Method | View Logs Command |
|---------|-------------|
| Docker | `docker logs <container_id>` |
| Kubernetes | `kubectl logs <pod_name>` |
| Linux (systemd) | `journalctl -u monitedge.service -f` or check `/var/log/messages` |

<Note>
`monitedge` follows cloud-native best practices by outputting logs to standard output rather than writing to separate log files, making it convenient for log collection systems to collect, and facilitating rotation and compression.
