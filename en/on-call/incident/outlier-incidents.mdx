An outlier incident is one that has never occurred in the past period. If an incident is identified as an outlier, responders should be alert. This is critical for On-call engineers because outlier incidents may have unknown impacts, and handling procedures may need to be decided on the spot. Some engineers may only care about outlier incidents—they create standardized processes or SOPs for resolving such incidents.

### Recognition Method

The system uses machine learning models to determine similarity between incidents. When similarity exceeds 90%, we consider two incidents similar.

When judging similarity, we mainly consider these factors:

| Factor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incident Title | Semantic similarity of title text |
| Incident Description | Semantic similarity of description content |
| Affected Service | Generally extracted from `service` label |
| Alert Resources in Incident | Generally extracted from `resource` label |

<Note>
When the system detects no similar incidents in the past **30** days, it marks the incident as an outlier.
</Note>
