## Incident List

Flashduty On-call provides two entry points to view the incident list. One is within a channel, the other is under the Incident Management menu. The difference is that under Incident Management, you can see incidents from multiple channels, even all incidents across the entire account.

| # | Feature | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Assignee | Defaults to incidents **Assigned to Me**, can switch to view all incidents in the account |
| 2 | My Channels | Defaults to all channels, can switch to view incidents in **My Channels** |
| 3 | Processing Progress | Filter incidents by progress, defaults to **All** |
| 4 | Time Filter | Supports relative time and custom range filtering |
| 5 | Search | Supports searching by incident ID; if assignee is set to "Assigned to Me", also supports fuzzy matching on "Incident Title" |
| 6 | More Filters | Supports rich dimension filtering including severity, labels, or custom fields |
| 7 | View Settings | Supports rich rendering options including **custom display attributes** and even aggregate views |
| 8 | Pagination | Pagination and items per page adjustment |

<Warning>
For query performance, **query time range cannot exceed 1 month**. To query data from more than a month ago, adjust the start and end times accordingly.
</Warning>

<Note>
To improve performance, when search conditions match more than **1000** incidents, the system only displays 1000+, not the exact number. Therefore, you can only view 1000 incidents through pagination. To see more, please adjust your search time range or use the [Incident Query API](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-110655782) to get all data.
</Note>

### Using Aggregate View

Aggregate view provides a different perspective for viewing incidents, where you can define different aggregation dimensions. The essence of aggregation dimensions is real-time Group By, such as viewing grouped by severity.

</Frame>

<Note>
To improve performance, in aggregate view, the system matches at most **100** records for aggregation. Therefore, the list you see may not contain all matching data. If this concerns you, please switch to list view.
</Note>

### Using More Filters

Flashduty On-call provides filtering capabilities across various dimensions with ample flexibility. Typical scenarios include:

- Search for incidents triggered by the "Host Down" alert policy based on `check` label
- Search for incidents marked as "false positive" based on the false alarm field

<Tip>
Flexibility often means lower performance, and Flashduty On-call is no exception, despite our many performance optimizations. We always recommend narrowing your query time range and using conditions like **Assigned to Me** and **Processing Progress** to reduce query scope.
</Tip>

### Custom Rendering

Under the **Settings** tab, select or deselect the following to customize incident list display:

| Option | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Basic Attributes | Define whether to show duration, responders, and other basic info |
| Custom Fields | Select platform-defined custom fields; if incident doesn't have this field, displays "-" |
| Labels | Filter and select labels; if incident doesn't have this label, displays "-" |

## Incident Details

Incident details is the main entry point for investigating incidents, displaying all available information. Especially on the incident overview page, Flashduty On-call centrally displays the information you need most.

| # | Area | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Key Information | Incident title, severity, processing progress, ID number |
| 2 | Action Area | Various high-frequency action buttons; more actions include custom actions and low-frequency buttons; War Room creation requires enabling [War Room](/en/on-call/advanced/war-room) in IM integration |
| 3 | Details | Incident description, label info; AI Summary can quickly extract incident details and output in three dimensions: event overview, impact scope, and actionable measures; labels support drag-to-sort and JSON view display |
| 4 | Associated Alerts | All [grouped](/en/on-call/channel/noise-reduction) alerts associated with the incident, supports filtering by progress and view switching |
| 5 | Comprehensive Info | Shows incident attributes, processing status, [images](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-344943718), and responder info |
| 6 | Custom Fields | Custom field configuration area |

You can switch tabs above to view more detailed **Associated Alerts**, **Timeline**, and **Change History** for root cause analysis. For closed incidents, the system also shows a **Resolution** page displaying root cause and resolution.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Console error: Due to the large volume of data, we are unable to respond...">
This error often appears on incident/alert list queries, analytics dashboards, etc. It's mainly because the system matched too much data and the query timed out.

In this case, please narrow your query scope, such as time range, or use more precise query conditions. If issues persist, please contact us.
