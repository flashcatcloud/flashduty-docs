## Acknowledge Incident

You have three ways to acknowledge a newly triggered incident.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Acknowledge via Console">
- **Single Acknowledge**: Click incident details in console, click **Acknowledge** button to complete
- **Batch Operation**: In console incident list, select multiple triggered incidents, click **Acknowledge** button for batch acknowledgment
</Tab>

<Tab title="Acknowledge via IM App">
- **App Messages**: App message main card provides an **Acknowledge** button, click the card to complete acknowledgment. If clicking the card has no effect, you may not have completed login account linking in the app or other reasons. See [Feishu/Lark Integration Guide](/en/on-call/integration/instant-messaging/lark) for details
- **Bot Messages**: Most bot channels push messages in Markdown format. You can modify notification templates to add an **Acknowledge** redirect link for jumping to console to acknowledge. See default templates for details
</Tab>

<Tab title="Acknowledge via Voice Call">
Flashduty On-call voice alerts remind you to **press 1 to acknowledge** at the end of the voice broadcast. Press key 1, and the system acknowledges the incident on your behalf.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Unacknowledge Incident

Once anyone acknowledges, incident progress changes from "Triggered" to "Processing". Others acknowledging won't change the progress.

After acknowledging, you can choose to **Unacknowledge**, useful for accidental acknowledgments. When all acknowledged personnel unacknowledge, incident reverts to **Triggered** status.

### Progress and MTTA

You can view each person's assignment time and acknowledgment time in the console. We calculate incident MTTA as follows:

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| MTTA Definition | Mean Time to Acknowledge, average acknowledgment time, the average difference between acknowledgment time and trigger time |
| Individual MTTA | For the same incident, each person can have different assignment and acknowledgment times, so each person's MTTA calculation differs |
| Overall Incident MTTA | Only calculates the difference between incident trigger time and first acknowledgment time |

## Snooze

After acknowledging an incident, responders may need time to investigate and handle it. **Snooze** can temporarily stop the incident from escalating per the expected escalation rule. After acknowledging, you can set a snooze duration like 2 hours, 4 hours, or a custom expiration time within 24 hours.

<Warning>
If you've snoozed and the snooze time has passed but you still haven't resolved the incident, the system automatically reverts the incident to **Triggered** status and re-initiates assignment notifications.
</Warning>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Snooze via Console">
Click incident details in console, click **Snooze** button, select snooze duration, done.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Snooze via IM App">
Click **Snooze** button on incident message card, select snooze duration, done.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Close Incident

You have multiple ways to close an incident.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Close via Console">
- **Single Close**: Click incident details in console, click **Close** button to complete
- **Batch Operation**: In console incident list, select multiple triggered incidents, click **Close** button for batch closure
</Tab>

<Tab title="Close via IM App">
App message main card provides a **Close** button, click the card to complete closure. If clicking the card has no effect, you may not have completed login account linking in the app or other reasons. See [Feishu/Lark Integration Guide](/en/on-call/integration/instant-messaging/lark) for details.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Reopen Incident

Manually closing an incident changes progress to **Closed**. You can click **Close** in any status. Once manually closed, associated alerts stop merging new events. If alerts haven't recovered in the original monitoring system, new notification events may occur, triggering new alerts and incidents in Flashduty On-call.

You can reopen accidentally closed incidents. After reopening, incident reverts to **Triggered** status and re-initiates assignment and notification.

## Merge

You can manually merge between incidents, or between incidents and alerts. Merging similar alerts and incidents together consolidates information into the same incident, accelerating the handling process.

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Merge Incidents | Select multiple incidents in console and merge into a target incident. Or in an incident's details, select other target incidents to merge into |
| Merge Alert to Incident | Alerts may be grouped into incidents by grouping rules, but you may want to adjust alert-incident associations. Go to alert details, click **Merge Into**, migrate the alert to target incident |

<Note>
The essence of merging is: changing alert-incident associations. If all alerts of an incident merge into others, that incident closes directly, and you only need to handle the target incident. Timeline completely records your modification process.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I snoozed an incident, why does the system still trigger new similar incidents?">
You may have confused **Snooze** with **Silence**, they're quite different.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Silence | Requires matching rules; when newly triggered incidents match silence rules, notifications won't be sent. Silence rules can affect new incident trigger notifications |
| Snooze | No rules required; only gives you time to handle the incident after acknowledging, preventing escalation to next level responders during handling |

If you need to suppress an alert policy, use **Silence**, not **Snooze**.
