title: "Past Incidents"
description: "Review historical similar incident resolutions to quickly handle new incidents"
---

When responding to incidents, being able to view resolutions from historically similar incidents can greatly accelerate resolution efficiency. The Past Incidents feature provides responders with a list of similar resolved incidents. For responders unfamiliar with the issue, they can quickly review the timeline, root cause, and resolution of past incidents, and replicate relevant actions. Past incidents provide the context needed to solve problems and prevent panic when responders encounter unfamiliar issues.

The system provides up to 5 similar past incidents to avoid information overload that wastes your review time.

### Ranking Principle

How do we rank them?

1. System only matches incidents with similarity greater than 90%
2. System prioritizes incidents with more detailed resolutions and root causes
3. System prioritizes incidents with higher similarity
4. System prioritizes more recently occurred incidents

<Tip>
Leaving **Resolution** and **Root Cause** when solving each incident is a good practice—it greatly speeds up future responders' incident response.
</Tip>

### Recognition Method

The system uses machine learning models to determine similarity between incidents. When similarity exceeds 90%, we consider two incidents similar.

When judging similarity, we mainly consider these factors:

| Factor | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incident Title | Semantic similarity of title text |
| Incident Description | Semantic similarity of description content |
| Affected Service | Generally extracted from `service` label |
| Alert Resources in Incident | Generally extracted from `resource` label |

<Note>
When searching past incidents, the system only matches similar resolved incidents within the current channel.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How far back can I view past incidents?">
Currently, you can only view similar incidents within 30 days before the current incident occurred. As time passes, the system may delete historical data, in which case you may not be able to view past incidents.

Regardless, for currently occurring incidents, you can review up to 30 days of historical data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I mark that current and past incidents are not similar?">
No, the system currently has no marking feature. But you can communicate and provide feedback through other channels.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I make past incidents more effective?">
- We recommend filling in complete root cause and resolution for important incidents
- We recommend enriching incident labels, especially `service` and `resource` labels
- We recommend enriching alert titles and descriptions to more accurately express incident symptoms
