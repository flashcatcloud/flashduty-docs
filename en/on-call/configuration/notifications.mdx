## Instant Messaging (IM) Integration

Integrating Flashduty On-call with your team's daily IM tools (like Feishu/Lark, Dingtalk) allows receiving and handling incidents in familiar collaboration environments, greatly improving On-call efficiency.

### App Integration (Recommended)

App integration provides the most complete interactive experience. We strongly recommend teams with the capability to use this method.

### Bot Integration

If your team cannot do app integration temporarily, using bots is a simple, quick, and effective alternative.

**Use Cases**:
- Cannot obtain IM platform admin permissions to install apps
- Only need basic incident notification push functionality, no complex online interaction needed
- Need to quickly establish notifications in temporary project groups or cross-department groups

## General Configuration

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to customize notification content?" icon="paint-brush">
Flashduty On-call allows you to customize personalized notification messages for different channels.

    **Configuration Path**: Console → Template Management
    
    Here you can select different notification types (like incident trigger, acknowledgment, closure, etc.) and edit message formats for each channel. Templates support variable references to dynamically display incident information.
    
    For more details, see [Notification Template Configuration](/en/on-call/configuration/templates).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How to configure different notification strategies for different severity incidents?" icon="layer-group">
    You can design refined notification workflows based on any dimension like alert severity, source, labels. This is mainly achieved through **routing rules** and **escalation rules**.
    
    - **Routing Rules**: Integration Center → Specific Integration → Routing Rules. Determines which alerts should be routed to which channel
    - **Escalation Rules**: Channel → Escalation Rules. Determines who incidents should notify, through which channels, and how to escalate when no one responds
    
    For example, you can configure: P1 level incidents first notify primary on-call via Flashduty App and Feishu/Lark app; if no one acknowledges within 5 minutes, notify their supervisor via voice call.
