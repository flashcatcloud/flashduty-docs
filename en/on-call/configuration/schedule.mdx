description: Flexibly configure schedules and rotation rules to ensure 24/7 incident response
---

In an On-call system, **schedules** are the bridge connecting "incidents" to "people". A well-designed on-call mechanism ensures someone always responds when incidents occur, while preventing any single person from being under high pressure for extended periods, enabling sustainable operations for the team.

Flashduty On-call provides highly flexible scheduling capabilities, supporting daily, weekly, and custom rotation cycles, as well as complex scenarios like day/night shifts and primary/backup on-call.

## Core Concepts

---

Understanding these concepts before configuration will help you better plan your schedules:

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Schedule** | An independent on-call unit (e.g., "SRE Schedule", "DBA Schedule") containing multiple specific on-call rules |
| **Layer** | A schedule can contain multiple layers of rules. For example, layer one is "Day Shift", layer two is "Night Shift". Multiple layers combine to form the complete on-call plan |
| **Rotation** | Determines how on-call personnel hand off. For example, "handoff every Monday at 10 AM" |
| **Override** | Temporarily adjust the on-call person for a specific time period without modifying permanent rules (commonly used for leave, temporary coverage) |
| **Date Mask** | Select which days to participate in on-call, e.g., Team A on-call Monday to Friday, Team B on weekends |
| **Continuous Rotation** | When enabled, rotation boundaries are calculated based on shift start time, preventing shifts from being split at 00:00. Only supported when date mask is configured. See [Date mask and continuous rotation](#date-mask-and-continuous-rotation) for details |

## Configuration Process

---

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Schedule">
    Go to **Schedule Management**, click "Create Schedule"
    - **Schedule Description**: Supports Markdown syntax, content can be included in notifications
    - **Owning Team**: Specifies which team manages this schedule, not the on-call personnel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Notification Reminders">
    To prevent forgetting shifts or handoffs, the system provides two reminder types:
    - **Handoff Notification**: N minutes before rotation (e.g., 15 minutes ahead), notifies both the outgoing and incoming personnel
    - **On-duty Notification**: During on-call periods, sends a daily notification at a fixed time (e.g., 9:00 AM) reminding who's currently on-call
    - **Channels**: Supports email, SMS, phone, IM (Feishu/Lark, Dingtalk, WeCom)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define On-call Rules">
    This is the core step. You can add one or more layers of rules. Each layer includes:
    - **On-call Personnel**: Select members participating in rotation
    - **Rotation Cycle**: Supports day, week, custom duration
    - **Time Restriction**: (Optional) This rule only takes effect during specific time periods
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Override and Leave

---

When on-call personnel need leave or have temporary conflicts, **don't modify permanent rules**—use the "Override" feature instead.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the Time Period to Adjust">
    In the schedule calendar view, locate the time period needing adjustment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Override">
    Click on that time period, select **"Override"**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Replacement Info">
    Select the **replacement person** and **specific time range**
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
- **Temporary Effect**: Only affects the selected time period; original rules automatically resume after the override ends
- **Audit Trail**: All override records are saved for later review
</Note>

<Tip>
We recommend having a brief sync meeting between outgoing and incoming on-call personnel before official handoff to confirm outstanding issues and current system status—this is safer than just system notifications.
</Tip>

## Date mask and continuous rotation

---

### Date mask

Date mask controls which days of the week an on-call rule takes effect. By selecting different day combinations, you can flexibly implement differentiated scheduling between weekdays and weekends.

Common use cases:
- **Weekday/weekend separation**: Team A on-call during weekdays, Team B on weekends
- **Specific day scheduling**: Assign certain personnel only on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
- **Day/night shift by day**: Configure day and night shift rules for weekdays, and full-day on-call rules for weekends

### Continuous rotation

By default, schedules are divided at 00:00 each calendar day. If a shift spans midnight, it will be split into separate time segments.

![Default Rotation](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/695199d7990bf99cafab58ed10be75a1.png)

When **continuous rotation** is enabled, rotation boundaries are calculated based on shift start time rather than the 00:00 cutoff. Each on-call member will complete a full rotation cycle without being split at midnight.

![Continuous Rotation](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/d56eca56d65aa17df67110ad4a0c61a7.png)

<Note>
Consider enabling continuous rotation in the following scenarios:
- Rotation cycle is 24 hours
- Shift start time is not 00:00
- Day-of-week date mask is configured
- Different rotation rules for weekdays and weekends
</Note>

## Common scheduling scenarios

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="24/7 Simple Rotation">
    **Requirement**: Ops team has A, B, C—each person on-call for one week, handoff Monday at 10:00 AM.
    
    **Configuration**:
    - Personnel sequence: A, B, C
    - Rotation cycle: 1 week
    - Handoff time: Monday 10:00
    
    **Result**: A on-call one week → B on-call one week → C on-call one week → A on-call one week...
    
    ![Simple Rotation](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/1a730fa3bf86e2bf206f1e4c9869371c.png)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Day/Night Shift Separation">
    **Requirement**:
    - **Day Shift** (9:00-18:00): Development team rotates
    - **Night Shift** (18:00-next day 9:00): SRE team rotates
    - **Weekends**: Monitoring team on-call all day
    
    **Configuration Approach**: Create multiple rules
    1. **Rule 1 (Dev Day Shift)**: Add dev personnel, restrict effective time to `Weekdays 09:00 ~ 18:00`
    2. **Rule 2 (SRE Night Shift)**: Add SRE personnel, restrict effective time to `Weekdays 18:00 ~ 09:00`
    3. **Rule 3 (Monitoring Team)**: Add monitoring personnel, restrict effective time to `Saturday 00:00 ~ Sunday 23:59`

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Primary/Backup On-call">
    **Requirement**: Critical business needs double coverage with a primary and backup on-call person.
    
    **Configuration Approach**:
    - **Within Same Rule**: When adding on-call personnel, you can set primary and backup together
    - **Notification**: In escalation rule notification recipients, you can choose to notify the schedule's primary or backup on-call
    - **Advantage**: No need to create multiple layers, simpler management
