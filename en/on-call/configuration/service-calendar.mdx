## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between a service calendar and a schedule?">
    They serve different purposes:
    
    - **Schedule**: Defines "who handles it", the recipient of incidents
    - **Service Calendar**: Defines "when to handle it", the time condition for escalation rules
    
    Service calendars are above schedules in hierarchy—first determining if it's a workday, then deciding whether to assign to on-call personnel.
