## FAQ

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I set personal notification preferences, why didn't notifications trigger?">
    1. Check if the channel has escalation rules configured. Without escalation rules, incidents won't trigger notifications
    2. Check the direct message channel settings in escalation rules. Only "Follow Personal Preferences" mode uses your personalized configuration; "Follow Unified Settings" mode ignores personal preferences
    
    Go to Channel Details → **Escalation Rules** to view current settings.
