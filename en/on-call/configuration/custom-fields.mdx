Custom fields extend incident description information. Flashduty On-call supports integrating most common alert systems, displaying pushed content in Labels. But you may need to record additional information, such as manually marking whether an incident is a false alarm. Custom fields are designed for this purpose.

## Configuring Fields

### Creating Fields

<Note>
An account supports creating up to **15** custom fields.
</Note>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter Configuration Page">
Go to Console **Incident Management** → **Custom Fields**
</Step>
<Step title="Create Field">
Click **Create Custom Field**, enter the following information:

| Configuration | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Field Name** | Identifies the field in API, cannot be modified after creation |
| **Display Name** | Shown on incident details page, can be modified after creation |
| **Field Description** | Helps incident handlers understand and use this field |
</Step>
<Step title="Select Field Type">
| Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Text** | Plain text input, max 500 characters |
| **Single-select** | Dropdown with single selection, max 10 options, each up to 200 characters |
| **Multi-select** | Dropdown with multiple selection, max 10 options, each up to 200 characters |
| **Checkbox** | Checkbox toggle |
</Step>
<Step title="Complete Creation">
Set options and default values as needed, click **Submit** to finish
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
If a field has a default value set, the system automatically writes that field when incidents are created. Note that field configurations only affect new incidents, not existing ones.
</Tip>

### Updating Fields

Only the following can be updated:

- Display name
- Field description
- Field options (single-select and multi-select types only)
- Default value

<Note>
Field updates only affect new incidents, not existing ones.
</Note>

### Deleting Fields

You can initiate deletion from the console at any time.

<Warning>
Deletion is a time-consuming operation. The system scans historical incidents and asynchronously deletes field associations. You cannot create a field with the same name until deletion is complete.
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why can't I search incidents by my created field?">
Please confirm whether the field type you want to search is **Text** type. To ensure system stability, searching text type fields is currently not supported.

<Tip>
If you need to filter incidents by field value, we recommend using **Single-select** or **Multi-select** types.
