## Billing and Subscription

---

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Flashduty On-call billing model">
    Flashduty On-call's billing model is based on the number of Licenses purchased, each License corresponds to one account member.
    
    For example, if you only purchased one License, only one member can use all Flashduty On-call features. You can still invite more members to join, but only members with Licenses can configure the platform, other members **cannot use any platform features** (limited to receiving incident notifications).
    
    ### License Allocation Methods
    
    Administrators can actively allocate Licenses to different members. When allocating, you can set the License type:
    
    | Type | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Fixed** | Valid for the purchase period, won't be preempted, suitable for members who need to handle incidents and configure business |
    | **Temporary** | Auto-released at the end of each cycle, can be occupied through allocation or preemption when sufficient Licenses are available |
    
    ### Members Without Licenses
    
    - Cannot use any features, including viewing incident list/details, **can only passively receive alert messages**
    - When configuring escalation rules, you can choose to notify members without Licenses
    - Members without Licenses cannot view, close, or perform other operations on incidents even if they receive messages
    - Members without Licenses share the tenant's email, SMS, phone package quota
    - Members without Licenses will see permission denied when logging into the console to view/handle incidents
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is Flashduty On-call priced?">
    We charge by active users and offer three different editions: Free, Standard, and Business.
    
    For detailed comparison, visit: [Pricing Page](https://flashcat.cloud/flashduty/price/)
    
    - We define active users as users who use commercial features that month; they must obtain a License to use
    - At the end of each monthly cycle, fixed Licenses held by active users remain valid, temporary Licenses are released
    - When a member is deleted, their License is automatically released
    - Viewing alerts requires a License; passively receiving notifications doesn't require a License

  <Accordion title="Why can't I receive voice notifications?">
   Voice calls are highly dependent on terminal signal and settings. If you persistently cannot receive voice notifications, try the following:

    1. If you're using a phone number registered outside Mainland China, check our supported region list
    2. Check your phone's blacklist or call records for blocking, usually landline numbers like 010xxx or 021xx; if found, remove from blacklist and whitelist
    3. If no blacklist is visible on the phone, there may be carrier-level blocking services enabled:
       - **China Mobile**: Check via WeChat official account "中国移动高频骚扰电话防护"
       - **China Telecom**: Follow official account "天翼防骚扰" to check
       - **China Unicom**: Follow official account "沃助理" to check, or call customer service
    4. If your number has been ported, check blocking status across multiple carriers
  5. Try restarting your phone, reinserting the SIM card, inserting the SIM into another phone to rule out terminal or SIM issues

  If you still can't find the cause, please contact us.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why can't I receive email notifications?">
   Try the following:

  1. Check spam folder in your email client; if found, move out manually to receive normally
  2. Check if your email client has auto-delete rules; if so, modify the rules
    3. Contact your company email administrator to check if blocked in backend (Enterprise email like Gmail has strict limits; too many emails may cause blocking). If found, whitelist the email source

  If you still can't find the cause, please contact us.
