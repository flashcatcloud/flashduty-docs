## Core Workflow

---

The Flashduty On-call workflow is very intuitive: **Alerts** enter **Channels** through **Integrations**, then notify specific **People** according to **Escalation Rules**.

## Step 1: Create a Channel

---

A **Channel** is the "war room" for managing incidents. We recommend organizing by business line (like "Payment Center") or component (like "MySQL").

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Channel List">
    Visit [Channel List](https://console.flashcat.cloud/channel), click **Create Channel**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Basic Information">
    Enter a name (like `My Test Channel`), associate a **Management Team** (make sure you're in the team)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Permission Notes**: Channels control permissions through **Management Team** and **Access Level** together:
- **Management Team**: The "owner" of the channel; only team members can modify channel configuration (integrations, escalation rules, etc.)
- **Access Level**: Can be set to **Public** (visible to everyone) or **Private** (visible to members only)
</Tip>

## Step 2: Integrate Alert Data

---

Now, let's bring monitoring system alerts into the system. Flashduty On-call provides two integration modes:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Dedicated Integration (Recommended for Beginners)">
    **Path**: Channel Details Page → **Integrate Data** → **Add Integration**
    
    **Features**: Point-to-point connection, alerts enter the current channel directly, no additional configuration needed, simple and quick
    
    **Steps**: Select your monitoring system (like Zabbix), save to get the dedicated **Push URL (Webhook)**, configure it in your monitoring system
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Shared Integration (Advanced)">
    **Path**: **Integration Center** → **Alert Events** → **Add Integration**
    
    **Features**: Unified entry, route distribution. Alerts first enter Integration Center, then distribute to different channels based on **Routing Rules** (like by `service` label)
    
    **Use Case**: Company-wide unified monitoring platforms (like Prometheus) that need to distribute alerts from different businesses to different teams
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
**Verify**: Manually trigger a monitoring alert. If the integration card shows **Latest Event Time**, the integration is successful!
</Check>

## Step 3: Configure Escalation Rules

---

When alerts come in, who should be notified? This is determined by **Escalation Rules**.

<Warning>
**Prerequisites**:
- To receive **Phone/SMS** notifications, first bind your phone number in **Personal Center**
- To receive **Email** notifications, first bind your email
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Escalation Rules">
    On the Channel Details page, switch to the **Escalation Rules** tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit or Create Policy">
    Click an existing escalation rule to edit, or create a new one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Recipients">
    - **Who to notify**: Select yourself or your team
    - **How to notify**: Check **Direct Message** (phone/SMS/email) or **Group Chat** (Dingtalk/Feishu group)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Configuration">
    Confirm and save the configuration
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
**Verify**: Trigger another monitoring alert. Your phone should immediately receive a call or SMS notification, and the IM group should also receive an alert card.
</Check>
