title: "Custom Change Events"
description: "Push change events from your own systems to Flashduty On-call via standard protocol. Most incidents are caused by changes, and linking changes with alert events helps quickly identify incident root causes"
---

<Tip>
Flashduty On-call has adapted webhook protocols for some common ticketing and deployment systems. For these systems, you should first use the corresponding integrations. This integration provides a standard HTTP interface that requires your development adaptation, with the benefit of integrating with any deployment system.
</Tip>

## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Enter Integration Center">
Go to Flashduty console, select **Integration Center => Change Events** to enter the integration selection page.
</Step>

<Step title="Create Integration">
Select **Custom Event** integration and define a name for the current integration.
</Step>

<Step title="Get Push URL">
Click **Save**, then copy the newly generated **Push URL** from the current page for later use.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Implement Protocol

Please refer to the [Developer Documentation](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/zh/flashduty/event-api/change-event) to complete protocol development.

## Best Practices

Labels describe events and should be as rich as possible:

- **Change scope**: such as host, cluster, etc.
- **Change ownership**: such as team, owner, etc.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why didn't Flashduty receive the change?">

**Troubleshoot in Flashduty On-call**

Check if the integration shows **Latest Event Time**. If not, Flashduty hasn't received the push—prioritize troubleshooting your system.

**Troubleshoot in Your System**

1. Confirm the request URL matches exactly with the URL in integration details
2. Confirm your service can access the external `api.flashcat.cloud` domain. If not, you need to enable external network access for the server, or specifically enable external access for Flashduty On-call's domain
3. Print Flashduty service response to check for specific error messages

If the root cause is still not found after the above steps, please contact us **with the request_id from the response**.
