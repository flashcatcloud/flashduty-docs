Through ServiceDesk Plus Sync Webhook, synchronize Flashduty incidents with ServiceDesk Plus requests for linkage between Flashduty and ServiceDesk Plus.

This integration is based on the v3 API protocol officially provided by ServiceDesk Plus and is compatible with its interface specifications. If you're using a private deployment version, please confirm whether its API supports v3. Additionally, there are differences in authorization configuration between ServiceDesk Plus cloud and private versions—refer to the relevant documentation for specific configuration.

  - [Cloud Version](#cloud-version)
  - [Private Deployment](#private-deployment)

When configuring this integration, if your selected sync direction is From_ServiceDesk_Plus, you can skip authorization configuration and go directly to [Configure Sync](#configure-sync).

###### Note: The Code is only valid for 10 minutes and can only be used once. After obtaining the Code, please complete [Integration Authorization](#integration-authorization) within the validity period.

### In Flashduty On-call

2. Select **Never Expire** for `Token Expiration`, copy the generated **Token** for later use, and complete [Integration Authorization](#private-deployment-authorization).

## Common Configuration

### In Flashduty On-call
#### Step 1: Integration Configuration <span id="integration-configuration"></span>

1. **Integration Name:** Define a name for the current integration.
2. **Management Team:** When a management team is selected, only team members and tenant administrators can edit this integration.
3. **Sync Direction:**

    - To_ServiceDesk_Plus: Sync Flashduty incidents to ServiceDesk Plus.
    - From_ServiceDesk_Plus: Sync ServiceDesk Plus requests to Flashduty.
    - Two-way: Flashduty and ServiceDesk Plus sync mutually.
    
4. **Trigger Mode**:
    - Auto Trigger: Configure conditions; Flashduty On-call will automatically sync incidents matching the conditions to ServiceDesk Plus.
    - Manual Trigger: Manually trigger ServiceDesk Plus sync from More Actions in incident details (the integration configuration name is the trigger name).

5. **Channel**: Select channels where this integration takes effect.
6. **Request Template**: Select the template to use when creating requests; if empty, tickets are created using the default template.
7. **Severity Mapping**: Choose to map severity, incident labels, or custom field values to ServiceDesk Plus priority field; if empty, the field is not passed when creating tickets.
8. **Custom Field Mapping**: Map labels or custom fields from incidents to corresponding text fields in ServiceDesk Plus tickets for automatic information filling. This feature supports syncing common context information (like service name, instance address, metric name) to ServiceDesk Plus for subsequent investigation and tracking.
    - Only supports target fields of single-line or multi-line text type.
    - Supports extracting values from incident labels (like service, instance) or custom properties.
    - If source field is empty, target field remains empty and won't overwrite existing content.

9. **Assignee Mapping**: When Flashduty incidents sync to ServiceDesk Plus and need auto-assignment to Technician or Group, use Flashduty incident label values as assignees (if corresponding assignee doesn't exist, sync will fail—choose carefully).
10. **Requester**: Specify the requester when creating tickets; must be configured if this field is required during creation.
11. Click `Save` to complete configuration.

## FAQ

<details>
  <summary> Can Scope be changed?</summary>
  No. The current Scope is already the minimum required. Flashduty needs get/create/update operations when syncing requests with ServiceDesk Plus, and needs to get priority/custom field lists when configuring integrations, so corresponding permissions are required.
