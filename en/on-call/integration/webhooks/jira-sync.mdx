Through Jira Sync Webhook, synchronize Flashduty incidents with Jira Issues for linkage between Flashduty and Jira.

## Prerequisites
- This integration is compatible with Jira Cloud, as well as Jira Server and Jira Data Center versions 7.x and 8.x.
- Currently only supports one-way synchronization of incident information or status to Jira; information in Jira will not sync to Flashduty.
- For Jira Cloud, enter the API Token in the authorization configuration password field; for Jira Server or Data Center, use your Jira account login password.

## Get API Token in Jira Cloud (Skip for Jira Server and Data Center)

- After logging into Jira Cloud, click the avatar in the top right corner and select **Manage Account**.
- On the **Manage Account** page, select the **Security** tab.
- On the **Security** page, click **Create and manage API tokens**.
- In the **Create and manage API tokens** dialog, enter the API token name and select an expiration time.
- Click **Create** to create the API token.
- After creation, copy the API token value and paste it into the API Token field in Flashduty authorization configuration.

## Configure Integration in Flashduty On-call

### 1. Create and Authenticate Jira Integration
<div className="hide">

In Integration Center, select **Webhook**, choose **Jira Sync** integration, and fill in the following authentication information.

</div>

- **Jira Platform Type**: Select based on your version. For Data Center version, select Private (Server).
- **Service Address**: For Cloud version, enter your actual access address, e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net; for Server version, enter your service access address, e.g., https://your-jira-server-url.com.
- **Username**: Your Jira account name. For Cloud version, enter your email; for Server version, enter your Jira account name.
- **API Token/Password**: Your Jira account password. For Cloud version, enter the API Token; for Server version, enter your Jira account password.
- After filling in, click **Next** for further configuration.

**About Permissions**: Ensure your Jira account has permissions to get related projects, issue types, and create Issues. We recommend using an admin account.

### 2. Jira Integration Configuration

- **Integration Name**: Define a name for the current integration.
- **Trigger Mode**:
    - Auto Trigger: Configure conditions; Flashduty On-call will automatically sync incidents matching the conditions to Jira.
    - Manual Trigger: Manually trigger Jira sync from More Actions in incident details (the integration configuration name is the trigger name).
- **Project ID**: Select the project to sync to in Jira.
- **Issue Type**: Select the issue type to sync to in Jira.
- **Channel**: Select channels where this integration takes effect; only incidents in these channels can sync to Jira.
- **Severity Mapping**: Cannot be configured if the selected issue type doesn't support the priority field.
- **Custom Field Mapping**: Optionally sync incident labels, all labels, or custom field content to Jira fields (only text-type fields supported).

### 3. About Updates

- For incidents that have already created Issues, if you update severity or status, Jira will auto-update, but Jira updates won't sync to Flashduty.
- Comments sync to Jira, but Jira comment updates won't sync to Flashduty.
- Updates to title, description, labels, and other fields in incidents won't update in Jira.


### 4. Flashduty to Jira Mapping

#### Field Mapping

| Jira | Flashduty | 
| ---------- | -------- | 
| Summary | Title | 
| Description | Description | 
| Priority | Severity | 
| Reporter | Integration configured user | 
| Comments | Comments | 


#### Status Mapping

| Jira | Flashduty | 
| ---------- | -------- | 
| Todo | Triggered | 
| In Progress | Processing | 
| Done | Resolved | 


### 5. Notes

- Flashduty On-call syncs information according to default field mapping and your configured custom field mapping. If your Jira issue type has required fields without mapping configuration, Jira Issue creation will fail.
- Jira Issue details are accessed using the format Project KEY + number. If you modify the project KEY, you may not be able to access via the Issue URL saved in Flashduty—modify the project KEY with caution.
