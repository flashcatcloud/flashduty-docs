Sync Harbor alert events to Flashduty via webhook for automated alert noise reduction.

## In Flashduty

### Create Harbor Alert Integration

You can obtain an integration push URL through either of these two methods:

#### Using Private Integration

Choose this method when you don't need to route alert events to different channels - it's simpler.

<Accordion title="Expand">
1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Channel**, and enter a channel's details page
2. Select the **Integrations** tab, click **Add Integration** to enter the integration page
3. Choose **Harbor** integration and click **Save** to generate a card
4. Click the generated card to view the **Push URL**, copy it for later use, and you're done
</Accordion>

#### Using Shared Integration

Choose this method when you need to route alerts to different channels based on the alert event payload.

<Accordion title="Expand">
1. Go to the Flashduty console, select **Integration Center=>Alert Events** to enter the integration selection page
2. Select **Harbor** integration:
      - **Integration Name**: Define a name for this integration
3. Configure the default route and select the corresponding channel (after the integration is created, you can go to `Route` to configure more routing rules)
4. Click **Save** and copy the newly generated **push URL** for later use
5. Done
</Accordion>

## In Harbor

### Configure Webhooks

1. Log in to the Harbor interface with an account that has at least project administrator privileges.
2. Go to `Projects`, select a project, and select `Webhooks`.
3. Select notify type `HTTP`, so the webhook will be send to a HTTP endpoint.
4. Select payload format as `Default or CloudEvents` when choose the HTTP notify type.
5. Select events that you want to subscribe.
6. Enter the alert integration's push URL in the Endpoint URL field.
7. Click Add to create the webhook.

## Severity Mapping

Currently, all alerts pushed to Flashduty through the Harbor integration are set to Warning severity. However, you can customize the severity using the [alert pipeline](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/alert-pipelines).
