Link integration allows you to extract key parameters from incident attributes, labels, and other information to quickly access external links.

## Configuration

Link integration supports extracting key parameters from incident attributes, labels, and other information to enable quick navigation to external systems. Through automated parameter filling and redirection, it eliminates manual input and improves efficiency in problem identification and resolution. This feature is suitable for incident troubleshooting, performance monitoring, and system debugging scenarios, helping optimize operations workflows and improve response speed and accuracy.

### Opening Method

#### 1. Popup
Opens a window within the current incident details page, maintaining the original interface state. Suitable for quick viewing or operations before returning.

#### 2. New Tab
Opens the link in a new browser tab. Suitable for scenarios where you need to preserve the current operation context while accessing external content.

### URL Configuration

When referencing labels in the URL parameter, prefix with `labels.`; when referencing custom fields, prefix with `fields.`; when referencing incident attributes, reference directly, such as `.title`, `.severity`, etc.

#### From Incident Labels
You can use `${}` syntax to dynamically extract values from parameters to construct the request URL. For example, parameter values can be automatically filled from incident labels, without manual input:
  
```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=${labels.sn}
```

In the above example, `${labels.sn}` means the `sn` label value from the incident will be dynamically injected into the URL. If the incident data contains `sn=VM123456`, the final request URL will be:

```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=VM123456
```


#### From Custom Fields
You can use `${}` syntax to dynamically extract values from parameters to construct the request URL. For example, parameter values can be automatically filled from custom fields, without manual input:
  
```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=${fields.sn}
```

In the above example, `${fields.sn}` means the `sn` custom field value from the incident will be dynamically injected into the URL. If the custom field data contains `sn=VM123456`, the final request URL will be:

```
https://cmdb.com/vm?sn=VM123456
```

### Notes

1. When the referenced content does not exist, the Link integration will still generate the corresponding link, but the value cannot be retrieved.
2. Each channel can bind a maximum of three Link integrations.
3. Pay attention to the reference syntax. If reference variables are not written according to the requirements, the corresponding values cannot be retrieved properly.
