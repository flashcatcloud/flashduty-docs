Noise reduction is one of the core capabilities of Flashduty On-call. When an alert storm hits, you might receive hundreds of similar notifications. The noise reduction feature groups these alerts into a single incident, so you only need to handle it once instead of being overwhelmed by repeated notifications.

## Why Noise Reduction

| Scenario | Without Noise Reduction | With Noise Reduction |
| :-------------- | :--------------- | :------------ |
| Server outage triggers 100 alerts | Receive 100 notifications, must handle each one | Receive 1 incident, handle uniformly |
| Network flapping causes repeated alert trigger/recovery | Notification bombardment, exhausting to respond | Marked as flapping, reduced interference |
| Batch alerts at midnight | Woken up multiple times by calls/SMS | Notified only once, sleep unaffected |

<Tip>
  **Core value of noise reduction**:

  - Reduce notification frequency, avoid alert fatigue
  - Focus on issues that truly need attention
  - Improve incident response and handling efficiency
</Tip>

## Core Concepts

Before understanding noise reduction, you need to understand the relationship between three core objects:

```
Monitoring System → Event → Alert → Incident
```

| Object | Definition | Source |
| :----- | :--------------------------- | :------------------ |
| **Event** | Raw notification from monitoring system, each trigger or recovery is an event | Zabbix, Prometheus, etc. |
| **Alert** | Automatically triggered by events, multiple events for the same alert merge into one alert | Automatically created by Flashduty |
| **Incident** | Primary object processed by Flashduty, triggered by alerts or created manually | Auto-triggered or manually created |

<Note>
  **Key understanding**:

  - One alert can contain multiple events (same alert's triggers, recoveries)
  - One incident can contain multiple alerts (similar alerts grouped together)
  - Noise reduction occurs at the "Alert → Incident" stage
</Note>

## Noise Reduction Process

When a monitoring system pushes alerts to Flashduty On-call, the system automatically executes the following workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Receive Event">
    Determine whether to merge into an existing alert, otherwise create a new alert.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Process New Alert">
    Determine whether to merge into an existing incident, otherwise create a new incident.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger Notification">
    New incidents notify relevant personnel according to escalation rules.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Subsequent Alerts Merge">
    Subsequent alerts merge into existing incidents without repeated notifications.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alert Grouping

Go to Channel Details → **Noise Reduction** to configure.

Alert grouping merges multiple similar alerts into a single incident for unified assignment and notification. When an alert storm hits, you only need to handle one incident instead of hundreds of repeated notifications.

<Note>
  New channels have alert grouping disabled by default. When disabled, each alert creates an independent incident.
</Note>

### Grouping Modes

Flashduty On-call provides two grouping modes:

| Mode | Use Case | Characteristics |
| :------- | :------------- | :--------------------- |
| **Intelligent Grouping** | Quick start, lower precision requirements | Based on machine learning semantic similarity analysis, no manual rule configuration needed |
| **Rule-based Grouping** | Need precise control over grouping logic | Exact matching by specified dimensions (attributes, labels) |

### Common Configuration

| Configuration | Description |
| :------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **Grouping Window** | Only group alerts within the time window, alerts outside the window trigger new incidents |
| **Alert Storm Warning** | Trigger warning notification when merged alert count reaches threshold, prompting urgent handling |
| **Strict Grouping** | When enabled, empty label values are treated as different; when disabled, empty values are treated as the same (not supported for intelligent grouping) |

      <Step title="Select Grouping Mode">
        Select **Intelligent Grouping** mode
      </Step>
      <Step title="Specify Calculation Fields">
        Specify fields to participate in calculation (up to 10)
      </Step>
    </Steps>

      ![Intelligent Grouping Configuration](https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashduty/doc/en/fd/aggr-3.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Rule-based Grouping">
    Exact matching by specified dimensions, only groups when all dimension values are identical.

    **Unified Control**: All alerts in the channel use the same dimensions for grouping.

    </Frame>
    **Fine-grained Control**: Match different grouping dimensions by conditions, use default dimensions or no grouping for unmatched alerts.

### Grouping Effect

After setting grouping by **Alert Check Item**, 5 alert notifications are grouped into 1 incident:

```
Incident: cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03, Critical

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.03:
      - Event1: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Critical
      - Event2: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 18%, Warning
      - Event4: es.nj.03, cpu.idle = 10%, Ok

  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.01:
      - Event3: es.nj.01, cpu.idle = 15%, Warning
  
  - Alert cpu idle < 20% / es.nj.02:
      - Event5: es.nj.02, cpu.idle = 19%, Warning
```

## Flapping Detection

When the same incident triggers and recovers frequently, the system marks it as "flapping" status to avoid notification bombardment.

Go to Channel Details → Noise Reduction → **Flapping Detection**:

| Option | Behavior |
| :-------- | :--------------- |
| **Off** | Don't detect flapping status (default) |
| **Alert Only** | Mark flapping status, continue notifications per policy |
| **Alert Then Silence** | Mark flapping status, no more notifications after first alert |

<Tip>
  "Same incident" refers to incidents with the same Alert Key, typically using the alert ID pushed from the upstream system as a unique identifier.
</Tip>

## Silence Rules

{/*
<video
controls
className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
src="https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashduty/video/silence.mp4"
></video>

*/}

During maintenance windows or known issue periods, silence rules can suppress alert notifications for specific conditions.

Go to Channel Details → Noise Reduction → **Silence Rules**.

### Silence Time

| Type | Description |
| :-------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **One-time Silence** | Active during specified time period, rule retained but inactive after expiration |
| **Recurring Silence - Weekly Mode** | Active at fixed weekly time periods, e.g., every Saturday 00:00-06:00 |
| **Recurring Silence - Calendar Mode** | Active on workdays/rest days per [Service Calendar](/en/on-call/configuration/service-calendar) |

### Silence Conditions

Define which alerts should be silenced, supports multiple condition combinations.

| Match Item | Description | Example |
| :------- | :--------- | :------------------ |
| **Severity** | Match by alert level | Only silence `Info` level |
| **Title** | Match by alert title keywords | Title contains "Planned Maintenance" |
| **Description** | Match by alert description content | Description contains "restart" |
| **Labels** | Match by label key-value pairs | `host=db-master-01` |

**Combination Logic**:

- **AND**: All conditions must be met to silence
- **OR**: Any condition met triggers silence

See [Configure Filter Conditions](/en/on-call/configuration/filter-conditions) for details.

### Silence Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
| :------- | :------------------------------- |
| **Drop Directly** | Alert doesn't appear in any list, no record |
| **Retain and Mark** | Alert appears in **Raw Alerts List** marked as "Silenced", can be filtered and viewed |

### Quick Silence

Quickly create temporary silence rules based on existing incidents.

**Operation Path**: Incident Details → More Actions → **Quick Silence**

- Rule name defaults to incident ID + title
- Effective scope is the incident's channel (cannot be changed)
- Default effective for 24 hours, automatically deleted after expiration
- Conditions default to exact match of incident labels

  ![Quick Silence](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/e80c2632d9065b28499edfa5a81a8505.png)
</Frame>

<Note>
  When repeatedly using quick silence on the same incident, it edits the original rule rather than creating a new one.
</Note>

## Inhibit Rules

{/*
<video
controls
className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl"
src="https://download.flashcat.cloud/flashduty/video/inhibit.mp4"
></video>
*/}

When a root cause alert exists, automatically inhibit related secondary alerts. For example: When a Critical level incident exists, inhibit Warning/Info level incidents for the same check item.

### Configuration Path

| Location | Path | Characteristics |
| :------- | :----------------------- | :------------ |
| **Channel** | Channel Details → Noise Reduction → **Inhibit Rules** | Only effective for alerts in current channel |
| **Alert Integration** | Alert Integration Details → Alert Processing → **Alert Inhibition** | Effective for alerts from this integration |

### Inhibit Conditions

When a new alert meets conditions, and there's an **active incident** (not closed) meeting conditions within 10 minutes, and both share equal items, the new alert is inhibited.

| Configuration | Description |
| :--------- | :------------------------------ |
| **New Alert Conditions** | Conditions the inhibited alert must meet, e.g., severity is Warning/Info |
| **Active Alert Conditions** | Conditions the inhibiting source alert must meet, e.g., severity is Critical |
| **Equal Items** | Attributes or labels that must be identical between both, e.g., check item, hostname |

### Inhibit Behavior

| Behavior | Description |
| :------- | :----------------------------- |
| **Drop Directly** | Alert doesn't appear in any list, no record |
| **Retain and Mark** | Alert appears in **Alert List** marked as "Inhibited", can be filtered and viewed |

### Configuration Example

**Scenario**: When Critical level alerts exist, inhibit Warning/Info level alerts for the same check item.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will the incident title change when new alerts merge in?" icon="circle-question">
    No. The incident title matches the first alert that triggered it and can be manually modified at any time; it won't change with new alerts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will incident labels change when new alerts merge in?" icon="circle-question">
    - **Manually created incidents**: No, labels list always remains empty
    - **Auto-triggered incidents**: Possibly, incident labels stay consistent with the first alert; if that alert's labels change, incident labels update accordingly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will alert labels change when new events merge in?" icon="circle-question">
    Yes. Alert labels always stay consistent with the latest merged event. However, if the new event is a recovery event, the alert keeps existing labels and only adds labels that didn't exist before.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the maximum number of alerts a single incident can group?" icon="circle-question">
    Up to 5000, mainly to ensure console rendering performance. Due to backend concurrent processing, actual count may slightly exceed this limit.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the maximum number of events a single alert can be associated with?" icon="circle-question">
    - **Rule-based Grouping**: No limit, maximum grouping window is 24 hours. After 24 hours from alert trigger, new events create new incidents
    - **Intelligent Grouping**: No limit, maximum grouping window is 30 days. After 30 days from alert trigger, new events create new incidents
