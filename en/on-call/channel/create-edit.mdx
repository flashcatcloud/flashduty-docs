A channel is the smallest unit for managing incidents in Flashduty On-call. It encapsulates alerts, integrations, escalation rules, and personnel permissions for specific businesses together, enabling alert isolation and precise assignment.

## Planning Channels

Proper planning can significantly improve operational efficiency.

| Scenario | Recommended Approach | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Independent business teams | Create channels by team | Clean alert data, precise escalation rules |
| Multiple businesses sharing monitoring | Create channels by business module | Avoid configuration confusion, reduce misassignment |

<Tip>
**Recommended**: Create separate channels for "Order System" or "DBA Team".

**Avoid**: Mixing unrelated businesses (e.g., "Office Network Devices" and "Core Trading System") into the same channel.
</Tip>

## Creating a Channel

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Creation Page">
    Go to **Channels** → **Create Channel**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill in Basic Information">
    Enter **Channel Name**, preferably named after business type or team
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Management Team">
    Select **Management Team**, members of this team have full operational permissions for the channel
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Access Level">
    - **Public**: Visible to all users in the account, can view and operate incidents but cannot modify channel configuration
    - **Private**: Only visible to management team, creator, and account administrators
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Auto-close Timeout (Optional)">
    - **Auto-close after incident trigger**: Timer starts from when the incident is first triggered, suitable for alerts without automatic recovery
    - **Auto-close after alerts stop merging**: Timer starts from the last alert merge, suitable for scenarios with alert grouping enabled
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Outlier Incident Detection (Optional)">
    When enabled, incident lists and notification content will include an "Outlier Incident" indicator for quick identification. [Learn more](/en/on-call/incident/outlier-incidents)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Creation">
    Click **Next** to complete creation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can skip [escalation rules](/en/on-call/channel/escalation-rule) or [integration configuration](/en/on-call/channel/integrate-data) during creation and manage them later in the channel.
</Note>

## Configuring Core Capabilities

After creating a channel, complete the following configurations on the details page:

### Integrate Alerts

Create alert integrations in the **Integrate Data** tab to bring monitoring system alerts into this channel.

- Each integration type generates an independent Webhook address
- Configure **drop rules** to filter test data or invalid alerts

<Warning>
Dropped events will not appear anywhere. If you're not receiving alerts, check the drop rules first.
</Warning>

See [Integrate Data](/en/on-call/channel/integrate-data) for details.

### Configure Escalation Rules

Define incident notification paths in the **Escalation Rules** tab: who to notify, how to notify, and how to escalate on timeout.

- Multiple rules are matched from top to bottom by priority, matching stops on first match
- Drag to adjust rule order

See [Configure Escalation Rules](/en/on-call/channel/escalation-rule) for details.

### Configure Noise Reduction

Converge massive alerts into fewer incidents in the **Noise Reduction** tab:

| Capability | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Alert Grouping** | Merge similar alerts from the same host or service into one incident |
| **Flapping Detection** | Automatically identify and suppress alerts that oscillate repeatedly in a short time |
| **Silence Rules** | Temporarily suppress alert notifications under specific conditions during scheduled maintenance windows or specific time periods |
| **Inhibit Rules** | Reduce redundant notifications using dependencies between alerts |

See [Configure Noise Reduction](/en/on-call/channel/noise-reduction) for details.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between management team and access level?" icon="circle-question">
    - **Management Team**: Controls who can modify channel configuration (integrations, escalation rules, noise reduction rules, etc.)
    - **Access Level**: Controls who can see the channel and its incidents. Public channels are visible to everyone but only the management team can modify configuration; private channels are only visible to the management team
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to choose between the two auto-close timeout policies?" icon="circle-question">
    - If the alert source doesn't have automatic recovery events and alert grouping is not enabled, choose **Auto-close after incident trigger**
    - If alert grouping is enabled, choose **Auto-close after alerts stop merging** to ensure all alerts within the grouping window are processed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is incident data still available after deleting a channel?" icon="circle-question">
    No, channel configuration (integrations, escalation rules, etc.) will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
