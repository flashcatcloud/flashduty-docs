description: "Bring monitoring system alerts into Flashduty On-call for unified alert processing"
---

Flashduty On-call doesn't generate alerts itself but serves as a unified alert center, receiving alert events from monitoring systems like Zabbix, Prometheus, Nightingale, and major cloud providers. Once integrated, you can use noise reduction, assignment, notification, analysis, and automation capabilities.

## Integration Methods

Flashduty On-call offers two alert integration methods:

| Comparison | Dedicated Integration | Shared Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Data Flow | Alerts go directly into the current channel | Distributed to one or more channels via routing rules |
| Configuration Difficulty | Out-of-the-box, no routing needed | Requires routing rule configuration |
| Typical Scenario | Single business team | Multiple businesses sharing monitoring platform |
| **Recommended Choice** | Just getting started, simple business | Alerts need to be distributed to different business channels based on conditions |

### Dedicated Integration

Integration created within a channel, alerts automatically enter that channel.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Integration Page">
    Go to Channel Details → Integrate Data → **Dedicated Integration**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Integration">
    Click **Add Integration**, select alert type
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Push URL">
    Copy the generated **Push URL** to your monitoring platform
  </Step>
</Steps>

</Frame>

### Shared Integration

Global integration created in the Integration Center, distributes alerts to different channels via [routing rules](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/routing-rules).

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enter Integration Center">
    Go to Integration Center → Alert Events → **Add Integration**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Integration">
    Select alert type, set **Management Team** (optional)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Push URL">
    Copy the generated **Push URL** to your monitoring platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Routing Rules">
    Configure **Routing Rules** to specify which channel alerts should be distributed to
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Shared integrations must have at least one routing rule configured, otherwise alerts will be dropped. We recommend setting up a rule without filter conditions as a fallback to prevent alert loss.

## Integration Features

Optional configurations for both integration methods, configurable on the integration details page:

| Feature | Description | Dedicated Integration | Shared Integration |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |
| Label Enhancement | Dynamically generate new labels through regex extraction, mapping tables, etc. | ✓ | ✓ |
| Alert Processing | Configure Pipeline to filter, modify, or drop alerts | ✓ | ✓ |
| Routing Rules | Distribute alerts to different channels based on conditions | ✗ | ✓ (Required) |

### Label Enhancement

After alerts enter the system, automatically add or modify labels for subsequent routing, searching, and analysis. Multiple enhancement methods supported:

- **Regex Extraction**: Extract key information from existing fields to generate new labels
- **Mapping Table**: Generate labels through predefined key-value mappings
- **Combination**: Add fixed label values to alerts

See [Label Enhancement](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/label-enhancement) for details.

### Alert Processing

Pre-process alerts through Pipeline, executing custom logic before alerts generate incidents:

- **Modify**: Adjust alert title, severity, description, and other attributes
- **Filter**: Drop unwanted alerts based on conditions

See [Alert Processing](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/alert-pipelines) for details.

### Routing Rules

Distribute alerts to different channels based on alert attributes (such as labels, severity, etc.):

- **Dedicated Integration**: No routing rules needed
- **Shared Integration**: Required, otherwise alerts will be dropped

See [Routing Rules](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/routing-rules) for details.

## Rate Limits

To ensure system stability, each integration has the following request rate limits:

| Limit Type | Limit Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **QPS** | 100 requests/second |
| **QPM** | 1000 requests/minute |

<Note>
Exceeding limits will return a `429` status code, please retry after waiting. Contact technical support if you need higher limits.
</Note>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving alerts from shared integration?" icon="circle-question">
    1. Check if routing rules are configured
    2. Confirm the source platform is triggering alert events normally
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is there a limit on the number of integrations?" icon="circle-question">
    Currently no limit.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are alert labels generated?" icon="circle-question">
    Flashduty On-call follows the "capture everything relevant" principle, putting key information into labels, description, or title. For dynamically generating other labels, configure [Label Enhancement](/en/on-call/integration/alert-integration/label-enhancement).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How is the alert title determined? Can it be modified?" icon="circle-question">
    Default is a combination of "Policy Name / Alert Resource". For customization, refer to [Reference Variables](/en/on-call/advanced/reference-variables).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to see which integration an alert came from?" icon="circle-question">
    Go to Incident Details → Associated Alerts → **Alert Source**.
