description: "Achieve efficient internal and external communication during incidents through a unified service status dashboard"
---

Service interruptions are inevitable, but communication efficiency can be systematically improved.

When service status fluctuates, relying on manual emails or instant messages for notifications can no longer meet enterprise requirements for information timeliness and consistency. Flashduty Status Page provides a standardized, unified information publishing window to ensure that both internal and external stakeholders maintain real-time awareness of service status.

<Tip>
Subscribe to the [Flashduty Official Status Page](https://status.flashcat.cloud/flashduty) to receive Flashduty service status updates first.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between Status Page and Uptime Monitors (Uptime Kuma)?">
    Both provide dashboards showing service availability, but with different purposes:

    | Dimension | Status Page | Uptime Monitor |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Audience | External customers & cross-department communication | Internal ops & technical teams |
    | Deployment | Third-party hosted | Self-hosted |
    | Monitoring Method | Relies on event reporting | Self-managed monitoring probes |
    | Focus | Transparent internal/external communication | Alert notifications to technical teams |

    **In short**: Use uptime monitors for service liveness checks; use Flashduty Status Page for official service status dashboards.
