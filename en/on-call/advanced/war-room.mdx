## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Flashduty implement war room management for incidents?">
    Flashduty implements war room functionality by integrating applications on IM platforms and calling related APIs for group chats, messages, and user information.

    <Note>
      When creating or connecting related applications, you need to manually grant necessary permissions to ensure operational security.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which IM platforms does Flashduty War Room support?">
    Currently supported IM platforms:

    | Platform | Status |
    | --- | --- |
    | Feishu/Lark | ✅ Supported |
    | Dingtalk | ✅ Supported |
    | WeCom | ✅ Supported |
    | Slack | ✅ Supported |

    <Warning>
      - Due to different levels of openness across IM platforms, the configuration process for accessing war room functionality varies. Flashduty On-call has simplified the configuration steps as much as possible during adaptation.
      - At any given time, the system only supports enabling war room functionality for one IM integration.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why is my war room functionality not working as expected?">
    War room is an advanced feature in IM integration. Please ensure you have completed all necessary configuration steps according to the official documentation. You can find related guides on the integration configuration page or in Flashduty Docs → **Integration Guide**.

    To ensure Flashduty can successfully invite members, it needs to obtain their user ID on the IM platform. Please ensure relevant personnel have completed at least one of the following:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Configure Notification Information (Recommended)">
        On the Flashduty On-call Personal Center → [Basic Information](https://console.flashcat.cloud/profile) page, fill in **Notification Email** and **Notification Phone**.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Use One-click Link Feature">
        If your IM integration supports it, use the **One-click Link** feature on the **Link Users** page. Flashduty On-call will use the notification email and phone configured in the user's personal center to call application permissions for user information linking.

        <Frame caption="One-click Link Users">
          ![One-click Link Users Interface](https://docs-cdn.flashcat.cloud/images/png/869cd0ab96ef916d1b3d1cc28d19745d.png)
        </Frame>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Sign In Within IM App">
        If your IM integration supports it, complete a sign in within the IM app to automatically link accounts.
      </Step>
