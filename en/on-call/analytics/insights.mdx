## Filter Conditions

When customizing filter conditions, the system remembers your selections. Even after refreshing the page, selected conditions are retained, but current user's operations do not affect other users.

| Filter | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Team | Select team names to query, supports multiple selection. Dashboard data updates based on selected teams |
| Channel | Select channel names to query, supports multiple selection. Dashboard data updates based on selected channels |
| Severity | Select severity levels to query, supports multiple selection. Dashboard data updates based on selected severity levels |
| Time Range | Select time range to query. Supports this week, last two weeks, this month, last month, and custom time ranges, but only up to the last **180 days** of data |
| Data Interval | Supports day, week, and month dimensions. Defaults to hourly queries, but when time range exceeds 31 days, daily preview is not available |
| Sorting | Team, channel, and individual dimension dashboards support ascending and descending order. Defaults to showing TOP 10 data; expand to show more |

## Time Period Segmentation

When performing 24-hour on-call, to distinguish the different impacts on team members at different times, we divide time into three periods:

| Period | Time Range | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Work hours | Monday-Friday 8am-7pm | Prime working hours for the team |
| Rest hours | Monday-Friday 7pm-11pm, Non-workdays 8am-11pm | Team members' rest or leisure time |
| Sleep hours | Every day 11pm-8am | Interruptions during this period significantly impact team members' rest quality |

## Metric Definitions

<Note>
Converged incidents do not trigger notifications, as they are typically defined as ignorable incidents. Therefore, all metrics exclude converged incidents.
</Note>

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Incidents | Number of incidents generated, excluding converged incidents |
| MTTA | Mean time to acknowledge an incident (acknowledgment time minus incident trigger time). Incidents without acknowledgment are not included in the calculation |
| MTTR | Mean time to resolve an incident (incident close time minus incident trigger time). Individual metrics do not include MTTR |
| Response Rate | Response rate calculation formula: Response Rate = (Acknowledged Incidents / Total Incidents) × 100% |
| Response Effort | Total time responders spend handling incidents. Calculated by summing the time between incident acknowledgment and resolution for each member, providing a rough estimate of actual time invested in incident response |
| Interruptions | Only counts assignment notifications via SMS, voice calls, and app push. Multiple channel notifications to the same responder simultaneously count as one interruption. Notifications within 1 minute of the previous one do not count as interruptions |

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="About MTTR">
When calculating Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR), the system cannot precisely determine whether an incident was resolved due to personnel intervention. Therefore, individual MTTR data is not included when calculating overall MTTR.

Incident resolution may involve various scenarios:
- Automatic recovery triggered by automatic alerts
- Manual closure by personnel
- Automatic system timeout closure
- Multiple members participating in handling the same incident

To ensure MTTR accuracy, the system focuses on the total time from incident occurrence to resolution, rather than evaluating individual member contributions.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="About Data Latency">
Since the system needs time to calculate data, there may be approximately one hour of delay when querying current data.
</Accordion>

## Alert TOP

The global dimension allows viewing TOP 20 data for alert check items and alert resources:

| Dimension | Description | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Alert Check Item | Aggregate and sort alert events by check item (from the alert's `check` label) | Adjust frequently occurring alert check items |
| Alert Resource | Aggregate and sort alert events by resource (from the alert's `resource` label) | Optimize frequently occurring alert resources |

## Data Download and Export

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Data Download">
All dimensions support downloading dashboards in PDF format for further data analysis and report generation.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Data Export">
Export incident list data in CSV format. Supports exporting incident list, team, channel, and individual dimension data, but exported data may not match displayed fields.

### Export Limitations

<Warning>
- Incident list exports do not include Labels data. For more detailed data, we recommend querying via the [Incident List API](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-110655782)
- Maximum data list query and export is 100,000 records. For more data, we recommend exporting in time segments
</Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="How can I query older data?">
Currently, insights only supports querying the last 180 days of data. For older data, use the [API Query](https://developer.flashcat.cloud/api-213441443).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why can't I view data at daily granularity when the time range exceeds 31 days?">
The dashboard line chart supports a maximum of 31 data points, so when the query time range exceeds 31 days, daily granularity viewing is not available.
